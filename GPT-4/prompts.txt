Task:
Identify Non-overlapping Custom Named Entities from the given Text by only using your Linguistic knowledge.

Context:
List of the following predefined entities which should be strictly followed:
ENTITY_TYPES = ['Disease_E', 'Anatomy_E', 'Cause_E', 'Diagnosis_E', 'Precaution_E', 'Riskfactor_E', 'Symptom_E', 'Medicine_E', 'Composition_E', 'Complication_E', 'Surgery_E']

Input: "text"

Output:
Two lists of double-quoted strings each on single lines:
entities = ["predicted non-overlapping entities from the text", ...]
entity_types = ["corresponding entity types", ...]

Special Remark:
1) You should always abide by the ENTITY_LIST and only find entities inside the given Text. Ignore the entity types that you do not find in a text, not all the entities will occur in a single text.
2) No Talk, just Output.

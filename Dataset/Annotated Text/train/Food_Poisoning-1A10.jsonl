{"id":1005,"text":"#Overview - Food Poisoning - 1A10\nFood poisoning is illness that results due to the consumption of food or drink which is contaminated with pathogenic bacteria, viruses, parasites, toxins or chemicals. Most people recover without the need for treatment. In most cases, the food that causes the illness has been contaminated by bacteria, such as salmonella or   Escherichia coli, or a virus, such as the norovirus. The contamination of food can occur at any point beginning from growing, till processing and shipping of the product. Improper cooking of the food may also be the cause for contamination other cause can be when pathogens are transferred from one surface to another especially in case of ready-to-eat foods or raw foods. Since these foods aren’t cooked before consumption, pathogens are not destroyed and ingesting them may lead to food poisoning. This is called cross-contamination. Thus the contamination of food may occur at any stage in the process from food production to consumption.","entities":[{"id":14697,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":533,"end_offset":560},{"id":14699,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":786,"end_offset":813},{"id":14700,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":818,"end_offset":827},{"id":14698,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":746,"end_offset":784},{"id":14701,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":845,"end_offset":859},{"id":14702,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":906,"end_offset":927},{"id":14689,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":26},{"id":14690,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":34,"end_offset":48},{"id":14691,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":99,"end_offset":200},{"id":14692,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":345,"end_offset":355},{"id":14693,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":361,"end_offset":377},{"id":14694,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":384,"end_offset":412},{"id":14695,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":414,"end_offset":439}],"relations":[{"id":7034,"from_id":14690,"to_id":14691,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7035,"from_id":14701,"to_id":14698,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7036,"from_id":14701,"to_id":14699,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7037,"from_id":14701,"to_id":14700,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1009,"text":"#Prevention - Food Poisoning - 1A10\nSome do’s and don’ts to prevent food poisoning at home: Wash hands nicely with soap and water before eating or preparing food. Utensils and cutting board should be washed with warm soapy water and disinfectants. Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly. Keep raw foods (raw meat, poultry, shell fish) and ready to eat foods away from other foods to avoid cross-contamination. Do not undercook foods. Reheat food rapidly until all parts of the food reach 75 degree C. Cook fish and meats at 145 to 165 degree F. Food should be discarded if there is uncertainty in its quality or safety. If one is suffering from food poisoning: Avoid eating solid foods.Take bland and easy to digest foods. Avoid alcoholic,caffeinated or sugary drinks. Replace fluids lost by diarrhoea or vomiting by drinking water or oral rehydration therapy. . Don’t take antibiotics or anti-diarrhea medications before consulting a doctor. Certain types of food poisoning (viz. listeriosis) are treated with intravenous antibiotics.

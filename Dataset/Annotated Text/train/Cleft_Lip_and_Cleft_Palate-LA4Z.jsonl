{"id":696,"text":"#Overview - Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate - LA4Z\nCleft Lip and Cleft Palate are common congenital malformations (birth defects), also known as oral clefts or orofacial clefts. Birth defects are health conditions that are present at birth and they change the shape or function of one or more body parts. During the development of lip and palate in early pregnancy period, incomplete fusion of upper lip and palate leads to the formation of cleft lip and palate in a child. A child can have a cleft lip, a cleft palate or both because development of lips and palate occur at different times during gestation. Children with these birth defects have difficulty in feeding and talking. They are also prone to ear infections, hearing loss, and dental problems.","entities":[{"id":11304,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":38},{"id":11306,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":84,"end_offset":124},{"id":11307,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":140,"end_offset":151},{"id":11308,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":155,"end_offset":171},{"id":11311,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":326,"end_offset":340},{"id":11305,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":46,"end_offset":72},{"id":11309,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":173,"end_offset":186},{"id":11310,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":288,"end_offset":292},{"id":11312,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":436,"end_offset":456},{"id":11315,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":624,"end_offset":637},{"id":11317,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":717,"end_offset":729},{"id":11318,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":735,"end_offset":750},{"id":11313,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":488,"end_offset":497},{"id":11314,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":501,"end_offset":513},{"id":11316,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":701,"end_offset":715},{"id":11319,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":389,"end_offset":409}],"relations":[{"id":5293,"from_id":11305,"to_id":11306,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":5294,"from_id":11312,"to_id":11319,"type":"affects_R"}],"Comments":[]}

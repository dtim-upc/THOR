{"id":1233,"text":"#Causes - Iron Deficiency Anemia - 3A00.Z\nIt can be due to: Anemia caused by destruction of red blood cells (Haemolysis): Inherited conditions, such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, stressors such as infections, drugs, snake or spider venom, or certain foods. Blood loss: Blood contains iron within red blood cells. So if a person loses blood, he or she will lose some iron. Women with heavy periods are at high risk of iron deficiency anemia as blood is lost during menstruation. Slowly, chronic blood loss within the body such as from a peptic ulcer, a hiatus hernia, a colon polyp or colorectal cancer can also cause iron-deficiency anemia. It can also be due to conditions like hemorrhoids, gastritis (inflammation of the stomach),and cancer, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as aspirin or ibuprofen, which can cause ulcers and gastritis. Lack of iron in the diet:The body regularly gets iron from the food we eat. If a person consumes too little iron, over time the body can become iron-deficient. Examples of iron-rich foods include meat, eggs, leafy green vegetables and iron-fortified foods. For proper growth and development, infants and children need iron from their diet. An inability to absorb iron: Iron from food is absorbed into the bloodstream in the small intestine. An intestinal disorder such as celiac disease, which affects the intestine's ability to absorb nutrients from digested food, can lead to iron-deficiency anemia. If part of the small intestine has been bypassed or removed surgically, that may affect the ability to absorb iron and other nutrients. Pregnancy : Without iron supplementation, iron deficiency anemia occurs in many pregnant women because iron stores need to serve their own increased blood volume as well as be a source of hemoglobin for the developing fetus.","entities":[{"id":17699,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":32},{"id":17700,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":77,"end_offset":120},{"id":17701,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":60,"end_offset":66},{"id":17703,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":175,"end_offset":186},{"id":17707,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":251,"end_offset":264},{"id":17702,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":152,"end_offset":170},{"id":17704,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":188,"end_offset":216},{"id":17705,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":218,"end_offset":223},{"id":17706,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":225,"end_offset":246},{"id":17708,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":266,"end_offset":276},{"id":17709,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":381,"end_offset":405},{"id":17713,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":495,"end_offset":529},{"id":17715,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":561,"end_offset":574},{"id":17716,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":576,"end_offset":589},{"id":17717,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":593,"end_offset":610},{"id":17718,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":626,"end_offset":648},{"id":17719,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":688,"end_offset":699},{"id":17720,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":701,"end_offset":740},{"id":17721,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":745,"end_offset":751},{"id":17722,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":760,"end_offset":805},{"id":17725,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":852,"end_offset":858},{"id":17727,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":874,"end_offset":898},{"id":17728,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1217,"end_offset":1241},{"id":17730,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1346,"end_offset":1360},{"id":17731,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1452,"end_offset":1474},{"id":17711,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":426,"end_offset":448},{"id":17712,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":452,"end_offset":457},{"id":17714,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":545,"end_offset":557},{"id":17723,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":825,"end_offset":834},{"id":17724,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":814,"end_offset":821},{"id":17726,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":863,"end_offset":872},{"id":17729,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1279,"end_offset":1290},{"id":17732,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1479,"end_offset":1546},{"id":17733,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1612,"end_offset":1621},{"id":17734,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1654,"end_offset":1683}],"relations":[{"id":8597,"from_id":17701,"to_id":17700,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8598,"from_id":17699,"to_id":17702,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8599,"from_id":17699,"to_id":17703,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8600,"from_id":17699,"to_id":17704,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8601,"from_id":17699,"to_id":17705,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8602,"from_id":17699,"to_id":17706,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8603,"from_id":17699,"to_id":17707,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8604,"from_id":17699,"to_id":17708,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8605,"from_id":17711,"to_id":17709,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":8606,"from_id":17718,"to_id":17713,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8607,"from_id":17718,"to_id":17714,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8608,"from_id":17718,"to_id":17715,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8609,"from_id":17718,"to_id":17716,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8610,"from_id":17718,"to_id":17717,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8611,"from_id":17699,"to_id":17719,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8612,"from_id":17699,"to_id":17720,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8613,"from_id":17699,"to_id":17721,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8614,"from_id":17699,"to_id":17722,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8616,"from_id":17699,"to_id":17724,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8617,"from_id":17699,"to_id":17723,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8618,"from_id":17699,"to_id":17727,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8619,"from_id":17699,"to_id":17728,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8620,"from_id":17731,"to_id":17730,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8621,"from_id":17699,"to_id":17732,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8622,"from_id":17699,"to_id":17733,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

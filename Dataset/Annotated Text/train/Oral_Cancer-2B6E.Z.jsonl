Most oral cancers look very similar under the microscope and are called squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of mouth cancer.

Smokeless tobacco: Smokeless tobacco is a general term used to refer to a range of products, such as: Chewing tobacco, Snuff – powdered tobacco designed to be snorted, Snus – a type of smokeless tobacco. Cannabis: Smoking cannabis has also been linked to an increased risk of mouth cancer. Human papilloma virus (HPV): The human papilloma virus (HPV) is the name of a family of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes that line your body, such as those in your cervix, anus, mouth and throat.

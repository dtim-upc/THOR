{"id":627,"text":"#Overview - Chalazion - 9A02.0Z\nChalazion is a chronic inflammatory granuloma of the meibomian glands caused due to the obstruction of the gland orifices and thereby stagnation of the secretions. Meibomian glands are the modified sebaceous glands present in the tarsal plates (thick fibrous tissue) of both upper and lower lids of each eye. There are about thirty to forty glands in the upper tarsal plate and about twenty to thirty in the lower tarsal plate. There may be acute infection of the secretions in Chalazion leading to small abscess formation known as Hordeolum internum. Similarly, glands of Zeis may develop acute infection and develop small abscess known as Hordeolum externum(stye).\n\n ","entities":[{"id":10210,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":47,"end_offset":101},{"id":10208,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":22},{"id":10209,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":32,"end_offset":42},{"id":10211,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":120,"end_offset":194},{"id":10213,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":307,"end_offset":339},{"id":10212,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":196,"end_offset":212},{"id":10214,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":373,"end_offset":380},{"id":10218,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":510,"end_offset":520},{"id":10215,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":387,"end_offset":405},{"id":10216,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":440,"end_offset":458},{"id":10217,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":473,"end_offset":488},{"id":10219,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":564,"end_offset":582},{"id":10220,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":595,"end_offset":602},{"id":10221,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":622,"end_offset":637},{"id":10222,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":673,"end_offset":697}],"relations":[{"id":4706,"from_id":10209,"to_id":10210,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":4707,"from_id":10209,"to_id":10211,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4708,"from_id":10218,"to_id":10217,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":4709,"from_id":10218,"to_id":10219,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

There may be single or multiple swellings. It may present with painful inflamed swelling which may be infected. Severe infection may lead to preseptal cellulitis (swelling of the lids). On examination, there is firm, nonerythematous,  nonfluctuant and nontender swelling. Conjunctival surface under the lid may show dilated meibomian gland. A gentle compression of adjoining glands may produce inspissated toothpaste like material which is clear and oily otherwise. There may be features of associated conditions like acne rosacea, seborrhoea or chronic blepharitis. Rosacea shows characteristic features like facial erythema, spider naevus, telangiectasia or there may be associated rhinophyma.

{"id":630,"text":"#Treatment - Chalazion - 9A02.0Z\nChalazion may be managed conservatively or by surgical means. Conservative treatment: 1. Application of moist heat and lid massage may help in liquefaction of secretions, thereby facilitating drainage of sebaceous secretions. 2. Steroid injection into chalazion through transconjunctival route is a good alternative to surgery. It may be repeated in   non responsive cases. 3. Systemic antibiotics may be useful as prophylactic measure in patients with recurrent chalazia associated with seborrhoeic dermatitis, acne rosacea or chronic blepharitis. Surgical management: 1. Incision and curettage is the procedure conducted under local anaesthesia to evacuate the contents of chalazion in most of the cases. 2.

{"id":1764,"text":"#Causes - Narcolepsy - 7A20.Z\nNarcolepsy is known to be caused by an autoimmune response. In 2010, scientists in Switzerland discovered that the reduction of chemical (hypocretin) in brain is caused by an autoimmune response to an antibody called trib 2. The trib 2 antibodies attack the areas of the brain that produce orexin. The attack leads to a deficiency in orexin, which results in narcolepsy and, in particular, narcolepsy with cataplexy (temporary muscle weakness).","entities":[{"id":23479,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":141,"end_offset":188},{"id":23483,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":255,"end_offset":276},{"id":23484,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":301,"end_offset":326},{"id":23481,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":202,"end_offset":253},{"id":23482,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":350,"end_offset":473},{"id":23476,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":21},{"id":23477,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":30,"end_offset":41},{"id":23478,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":66,"end_offset":88}],"relations":[{"id":11884,"from_id":23477,"to_id":23478,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":1765,"text":"#Diagnosis - Narcolepsy - 7A20.Z\nDiagnosis is relatively easy when all the symptoms of narcolepsy are present, but if the sleep attacks are isolated and cataplexy is mild or absent, diagnosis is more difficult. It is also possible for cataplexy to occur in isolation . Three tests that are commonly used in diagnosing narcolepsy are: The polysomnogram: The polysomnogram involves continuous recording of sleep brain waves and a number of nerve and muscle functions during nighttime sleep. Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT): For the Multiple sleep latency test, a person is given a chance to sleep every 2 hours during normal waking time. Epworth Sleepiness Scale: The Epworth sleepiness scale is a brief questionnaire that is administered to determine the likelihood of the presence of a sleep disorder, including narcolepsy.","entities":[{"id":23485,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":24},{"id":23486,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":87,"end_offset":98},{"id":23487,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":275,"end_offset":281},{"id":23488,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":318,"end_offset":329},{"id":23489,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":334,"end_offset":351},{"id":23491,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":639,"end_offset":663},{"id":23492,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":815,"end_offset":825},{"id":23490,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":489,"end_offset":523},{"id":23493,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":789,"end_offset":803}],"relations":[{"id":11885,"from_id":23488,"to_id":23489,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":11886,"from_id":23485,"to_id":23490,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":11888,"from_id":23492,"to_id":23491,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":1766,"text":"#Overview - Narcolepsy - 7A20.Z\nNarcolepsy is a neurological disorder caused by the brain's inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles. It is a disorder in which a person falls asleep at inappropriate times. People with narcolepsy generally experience disturbed nocturnal sleep and an abnormal daytime sleep pattern, which is often confused with insomnia. Narcoleptics, when falling asleep, generally experience the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) stage of sleep within 5 minutes, while most people without narcolepsy may not experience REM sleep until an hour. REM sleep is where most dreams occur.","entities":[{"id":23494,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":23},{"id":23496,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":48,"end_offset":69},{"id":23497,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":80,"end_offset":131},{"id":23499,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":249,"end_offset":351},{"id":23495,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":32,"end_offset":43},{"id":23498,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":217,"end_offset":228},{"id":23500,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":497,"end_offset":508},{"id":23501,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":409,"end_offset":469}],"relations":[{"id":11889,"from_id":23495,"to_id":23496,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11892,"from_id":23500,"to_id":23501,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":11890,"from_id":23495,"to_id":23497,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":11891,"from_id":23498,"to_id":23499,"type":"has_symptom_R"}],"Comments":[]}

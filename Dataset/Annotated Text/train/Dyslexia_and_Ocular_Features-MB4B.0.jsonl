{"id":1209,"text":"#Causes - Dyslexia and Ocular Features - MB4B.0\nThe aetiology of dyslexia is unknown. It is believed to have both genetic and neural processing deficits. Genetics: Most genetic studies have focused on genes implicated in reading ability and disability, particularly those associated with word reading and spelling difficulties. Neural: Dyslexia may have its origin in the complex neurobiological events that underlie language acquisition and processing as it pertains to writing and reading. Phonological model: Phonological model is the most widely accepted. Reading is a decoding skill while spelling and writing are encoding skills.","entities":[{"id":17404,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":38},{"id":17406,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":114,"end_offset":152},{"id":17405,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":65,"end_offset":74},{"id":17407,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":201,"end_offset":207},{"id":17408,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":336,"end_offset":345}],"relations":[{"id":8440,"from_id":17405,"to_id":17406,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":1210,"text":"#Diagnosis - Dyslexia and Ocular Features - MB4B.0\nThe Diagnosis of dyslexia should not be made in isolation and should be by multidisciplinary team. The diagnosis requires a detailed reading assessment and phonological processing. Systemic features: Learning difficulties, especially mathematical and linguistic skills are affected most. Linguistic learning difficulties may also involve difficulties with spelling and written expression. Ophthalmological features: There are no recognised ocular features that are characteristic or specific to dyslexia. The contribution of these defects is usually minor and does not contribute to the aetiology of dyslexia.","entities":[{"id":17409,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":41},{"id":17412,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":251,"end_offset":337},{"id":17414,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":546,"end_offset":554},{"id":17415,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":651,"end_offset":659},{"id":17410,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":68,"end_offset":77},{"id":17413,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":339,"end_offset":438}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1212,"text":"#Overview - Dyslexia and Ocular Features - MB4B.0\nDyslexia is the commonly accepted term for difficulty in reading.  Dyslexia refers to a pattern of learning difficulties characterised by problems with accurate or fluent word recognition, poor decoding, and poor spelling abilities. Specific Learning Disorder (SLD) in reading\/decoding single word is also known as dyslexia.  SLD is one of the six neuro-developmental disorders delineated in fifth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5).","entities":[{"id":17422,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":93,"end_offset":114},{"id":17423,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":117,"end_offset":126},{"id":17424,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":365,"end_offset":373},{"id":17426,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":376,"end_offset":380},{"id":17420,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":40},{"id":17421,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":50,"end_offset":59},{"id":17425,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":283,"end_offset":347}],"relations":[{"id":8445,"from_id":17424,"to_id":17425,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":8444,"from_id":17421,"to_id":17422,"type":"has_symptom_R"}],"Comments":[]}

The recognition of normal intelligence allows setting of appropriate educational needs. For dyslexic patients, books-on-tape or non-written information is much more effective than written material. Ocular: Any significant visual defect is treated accordingly. This may include: Prescription of glasses for significant refractive error. Treatment of phorias with symptoms of asthenopia.

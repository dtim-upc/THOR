Microscopic identification of cysts and trophozoites in the stool is the common method for diagnosing E. histolytica. In addition, E. histolytica trophozoites can also be identified in aspirates or biopsy samples obtained during colonoscopy or surgery. Immunodiagnosis - Antibody Detection- a) Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is most useful in patients with extra-intestinal disease (i.e., amoebic liver abscess) when organisms are not generally found on stool examination. b)  Indirect hemagglutination (IHA). If antibodies are not detectable in patients with an acute presentation of suspected amoebic liver abscess, a second specimen should be drawn 7-10 days later. Antigen Detection- Antigen detection may be useful as an adjunct to microscopic diagnosis in detecting parasites and to distinguish between pathogenic and nonpathogenic infections.

{"id":576,"text":"#Overview - Bruxism - DA0E.7\nHabitual grinding or clenching of teeth, either during sleep or as an unconscious habit during waking hours, is known as Bruxism and commonly called as “Teeth Grinding”. Pavon described bruxism as one of the most common, complex and destructive dental functional disorder (parafunctional habit). Initially, it is difficult to identify mainly as the patients themselves are unaware of it. According to Nadler, bruxism affect a large percentage of the population, including all age groups. In some individuals it may be considered as an attempt to cope with stress and anxiety. Bruxism, usually, does not have any harmful effects but when it occurs on regular basis, it causes tooth wear, occlusal trauma, temporomandibular joint problems, and hypertrophy of muscles. Correct diagnosis is necessary for its treatment.","entities":[{"id":9681,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":19},{"id":9682,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":29,"end_offset":68},{"id":9683,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":150,"end_offset":157},{"id":9684,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":182,"end_offset":196},{"id":9685,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":215,"end_offset":222},{"id":9686,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":281,"end_offset":323},{"id":9687,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":336,"end_offset":338},{"id":9688,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":438,"end_offset":445},{"id":9689,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":585,"end_offset":591},{"id":9690,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":596,"end_offset":603},{"id":9691,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":537,"end_offset":539},{"id":9692,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":605,"end_offset":612},{"id":9693,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":704,"end_offset":715},{"id":9695,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":733,"end_offset":765},{"id":9696,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":771,"end_offset":793},{"id":9694,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":716,"end_offset":731},{"id":9698,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":830,"end_offset":833},{"id":9697,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":803,"end_offset":812}],"relations":[{"id":4404,"from_id":9692,"to_id":9693,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":4405,"from_id":9692,"to_id":9694,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":4406,"from_id":9692,"to_id":9695,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":4407,"from_id":9692,"to_id":9696,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":4408,"from_id":9698,"to_id":9697,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4401,"from_id":9685,"to_id":9686,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":4400,"from_id":9683,"to_id":9682,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":4402,"from_id":9691,"to_id":9689,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":4403,"from_id":9691,"to_id":9690,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

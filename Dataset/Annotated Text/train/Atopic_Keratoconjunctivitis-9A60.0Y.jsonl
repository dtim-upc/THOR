{"id":345,"text":"#Causes - Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.0Y\nAtopic keratoconjunctivitis is a chronic allergic conjunctivitis and may be due to: Hypersensitivity response: All ocular allergic disorders are characterised by a hypersensitivity response, defined as an excessive reaction of the normal immune system, usually by exposure to an inciting antigen. Genetic predisposition: A genetic predisposition combined with antigen sensitisation is suspected in AKC and its associated disease, atopic dermatitis. AKC may, however, represent either a common manifestation end point for a number of abnormal gene processes, or a single gene defect with variable phenotypic expression, modified by other gene polymorphisms and the environment. Epithelial barrier defect: More recent studies suggest that an epithelial barrier defect may be responsible rather than a defect in immune-regulatory function.","entities":[{"id":6308,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":37},{"id":6309,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":48,"end_offset":75},{"id":6310,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":81,"end_offset":112},{"id":6311,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":132,"end_offset":157},{"id":6313,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":170,"end_offset":188},{"id":6317,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":212,"end_offset":237},{"id":6323,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":327,"end_offset":343},{"id":6324,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":345,"end_offset":367},{"id":6325,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":371,"end_offset":393},{"id":6328,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":408,"end_offset":429},{"id":6329,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":446,"end_offset":449},{"id":6330,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":478,"end_offset":495},{"id":6332,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":497,"end_offset":500},{"id":6336,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":581,"end_offset":604},{"id":6339,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":611,"end_offset":665},{"id":6344,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":667,"end_offset":723},{"id":6345,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":725,"end_offset":749},{"id":6349,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":788,"end_offset":813}],"relations":[{"id":2649,"from_id":6309,"to_id":6310,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":2650,"from_id":6309,"to_id":6311,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2654,"from_id":6308,"to_id":6323,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2655,"from_id":6308,"to_id":6324,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2656,"from_id":6329,"to_id":6328,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2657,"from_id":6329,"to_id":6330,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":2658,"from_id":6332,"to_id":6336,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2659,"from_id":6332,"to_id":6339,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2664,"from_id":6332,"to_id":6344,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2665,"from_id":6308,"to_id":6345,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":348,"text":"#Overview - Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis - 9A60.0Y\nAtopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) is a relatively uncommon, but potentially blinding ocular (eye) disease, which typically affects young people with atopic dermatitis.  AKC is a severe chronic inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva which may have dramatic consequences for visual function. The incidence of atopic dermatitis is greatest in paediatric population. AKC may occur at any time after the onset of the associated dermatitis or other atopic condition, and is not necessarily correlated with exacerbations of these conditions. The initial presentation of ocular symptoms in AKC most commonly occurs in the second to third decade of life, with some patients presenting earlier or later (range varies from late teens to 50 years with peak age of incidence in people aged 30-50 years). Visually significant complications most frequently occur in the fourth to fifth decades, with more men affected than women. The condition then remains chronic for years, usually requiring lifelong treatment. An earlier onset of AKC carries the greatest risk for tear film abnormalities and greater ocular surface damage. Classically involved skin areas of atopic dermatitis are lateral neck folds, antecubital (in-front of the elbow) and popliteal (back of knee joint) fossae, but may involve other parts of body including eyelid.","entities":[{"id":6320,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":39},{"id":6321,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":50,"end_offset":83},{"id":6322,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":126,"end_offset":155},{"id":6326,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":199,"end_offset":216},{"id":6327,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":219,"end_offset":222},{"id":6333,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":228,"end_offset":282},{"id":6334,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":358,"end_offset":375},{"id":6338,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":414,"end_offset":417},{"id":6340,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":474,"end_offset":484},{"id":6341,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":494,"end_offset":510},{"id":6342,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":633,"end_offset":636},{"id":6343,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":614,"end_offset":629},{"id":6346,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1070,"end_offset":1073},{"id":6347,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1104,"end_offset":1127},{"id":6348,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1132,"end_offset":1161},{"id":6350,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1184,"end_offset":1188},{"id":6351,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1198,"end_offset":1215},{"id":6352,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1220,"end_offset":1238},{"id":6353,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1240,"end_offset":1275},{"id":6354,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1280,"end_offset":1317},{"id":6355,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1365,"end_offset":1371}],"relations":[{"id":2660,"from_id":6338,"to_id":6340,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":2661,"from_id":6338,"to_id":6341,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":2662,"from_id":6342,"to_id":6343,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2666,"from_id":6346,"to_id":6347,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":2667,"from_id":6346,"to_id":6348,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"}],"Comments":[]}

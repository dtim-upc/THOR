{"id":1047,"text":"#Complications - Haemophilia - 3B10.0\nJoint damage: Joint damage can sometimes develop if hemophilia is poorly controlled. Successive joint bleeds can damage cartilage (the soft spongy tissue in joints that acts as a shock absorber) as well as the synovium (a thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the joint). The more damaged a joint is, the more vulnerable it is to internal bleeding. This in turn means the joint will become even more damaged and vulnerable to bleeding. Joint damage is more common in older adults with severe hemophilia.","entities":[{"id":15116,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":17,"end_offset":28},{"id":15118,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":90,"end_offset":100},{"id":15119,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":123,"end_offset":146},{"id":15120,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":158,"end_offset":232},{"id":15121,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":248,"end_offset":316},{"id":15122,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":376,"end_offset":393},{"id":15123,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":418,"end_offset":423},{"id":15124,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":446,"end_offset":453},{"id":15125,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":472,"end_offset":480},{"id":15127,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":531,"end_offset":548},{"id":15117,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":38,"end_offset":50},{"id":15126,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":482,"end_offset":494}],"relations":[{"id":7289,"from_id":15116,"to_id":15125,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":7288,"from_id":15116,"to_id":15124,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":7286,"from_id":15116,"to_id":15119,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":7284,"from_id":15119,"to_id":15121,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":7290,"from_id":15127,"to_id":15126,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":7287,"from_id":15124,"to_id":15123,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":7285,"from_id":15116,"to_id":15122,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":7283,"from_id":15119,"to_id":15120,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":7282,"from_id":15118,"to_id":15117,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1049,"text":"#Overview - Haemophilia - 3B10.0\nHemophilia is an inherited condition that affects the blood’s ability to clot. Hemophilia A (clotting factor VIII deficiency) is the most common form of the disorder, present in about 1 in 5,000–10,000 births. Hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) occurs in around 1 in about 20,000–34,000 births. Hemophilia is more likely to occur in males than females. The factors which clot (solidify) the blood is low in patients of Hemophilia. Thus when a blood vessel is injured, a temporary scab does form, but the missing coagulation factors prevent fibrin formation, which is necessary to maintain the blood clot.","entities":[{"id":15142,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":23},{"id":15143,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":33,"end_offset":43},{"id":15146,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":112,"end_offset":122},{"id":15147,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":126,"end_offset":157},{"id":15148,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":190,"end_offset":198},{"id":15149,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":243,"end_offset":255},{"id":15150,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":329,"end_offset":339},{"id":15152,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":453,"end_offset":463},{"id":15154,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":477,"end_offset":489},{"id":15155,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":493,"end_offset":500},{"id":15157,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":574,"end_offset":590},{"id":15144,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":50,"end_offset":69},{"id":15145,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":75,"end_offset":110},{"id":15151,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":358,"end_offset":385},{"id":15153,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":405,"end_offset":437},{"id":15156,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":504,"end_offset":518}],"relations":[{"id":7297,"from_id":15146,"to_id":15148,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":7299,"from_id":15152,"to_id":15153,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":7298,"from_id":15150,"to_id":15151,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":7296,"from_id":15143,"to_id":15145,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":7295,"from_id":15143,"to_id":15144,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1136,"text":"#Diagnosis - Hypertensive Retinopathy - 9B71.1\nDiagnosis of hypertensive retinopathy is based on presence of systemic hypertension and examination of retina (by an eye specialist) after dilating the pupil. Retinal or Fundus examination: It may show: Narrowing of blood vessels (vasoconstriction): Blood vessels may show generalised or localised narrowing. Severe hypertension may lead to obstruction of arterioles and formation of cotton-wool spots. Leakage: Abnormal vascular permeability leads to retinal oedema, flame-shaped haemorrhages and formation of hard exudates. Hard exudates may be arranged as macular star around the fovea. There may be swelling of the optic nerve head as disc oedema in malignant hypertension. Systemic hypertension may show other ocular manifestations such as: Retinal artery occlusion. Branch retinal vein occlusion. Retinal arterial macroaneurysm. Ischaemic choroidal infarcts (Elschnig’s spots). Ischaemic optic neuropathy. Fluorescein angiography test: Acute malignant hypertension on fluorescein angiography shows non-perfusion of retinal capillaries, microaneurysms and dendritic pattern of choroidal filling in early phase.

{"id":1560,"text":"#Causes - Jaundice - ME10.1\nJaundice is classified into three categories, depending on which part of the physiological mechanism the pathology affects. The three categories are: Pre-hepatic jaundice: Pre hepatic jaundice is due to increased rate of haemolysis (breakdown of RBCs). Causes of haemolysis include: Malaria, Sickle cell anemia, Thalassaemia, Gilbert syndrome. Hepatocellular jaundice: Hepato cellular jaundice can be due to any infection in the liver. It can be due to infection or exposure to a harmful substance, such as alcohol, disrupts the liverâ€™s ability to process bilirubin. Post hepatic jaundice: Post-hepatic jaundice, is also called as obstructive jaundice, is caused by an interruption to the drainage of bile in the biliary system.","entities":[{"id":21079,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":19},{"id":21081,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":28,"end_offset":37},{"id":21083,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":178,"end_offset":198},{"id":21086,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":231,"end_offset":279},{"id":21090,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":320,"end_offset":338},{"id":21092,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":354,"end_offset":370},{"id":21093,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":372,"end_offset":395},{"id":21088,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":291,"end_offset":302},{"id":21089,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":311,"end_offset":318},{"id":21091,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":340,"end_offset":352},{"id":21094,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":436,"end_offset":462},{"id":21095,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":464,"end_offset":467},{"id":21096,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":481,"end_offset":593},{"id":21099,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":694,"end_offset":755},{"id":21097,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":595,"end_offset":616},{"id":21098,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":659,"end_offset":679}],"relations":[{"id":10537,"from_id":21079,"to_id":21092,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10538,"from_id":21093,"to_id":21094,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10540,"from_id":21098,"to_id":21099,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10539,"from_id":21095,"to_id":21096,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10533,"from_id":21083,"to_id":21086,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10534,"from_id":21079,"to_id":21089,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10535,"from_id":21079,"to_id":21090,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10536,"from_id":21079,"to_id":21091,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":415,"text":"#Overview - Asbestos - CB20\nAsbestos is a group of naturally occurring fibrous minerals which are commercially used for insulation in buildings and as an ingredient in a number of products such as roofing tiles, water supply lines, and fire blankets, as well as clutches and brake linings, gaskets, and pads for automobiles. Asbestos causes cancer and chronic respiratory diseases in humans. All forms of asbestos (chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, tremolite, actinolite and anthophyllite) are in use because of their extraordinary tensile strength, poor heat conduction, and relative resistance to chemical attack. Chemically, asbestos minerals are silicate compounds, meaning they contain atoms of silicon and oxygen in their molecular structure. All forms of asbestos are carcinogenic to humans. Exposure to asbestos (including chrysotile) causes cancer of the lung, larynx, and ovaries, and also mesothelioma (a cancer of the pleural and peritoneal linings). Asbestos exposure is also responsible for other diseases such as asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs), and plaques, thickening and effusion in the pleura.","entities":[{"id":7508,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":21},{"id":7509,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":28,"end_offset":37},{"id":7511,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":341,"end_offset":348},{"id":7518,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":850,"end_offset":912},{"id":7520,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1028,"end_offset":1114},{"id":7516,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":775,"end_offset":788},{"id":7517,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":799,"end_offset":819},{"id":7519,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":963,"end_offset":980},{"id":7510,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":325,"end_offset":334},{"id":7512,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":352,"end_offset":380},{"id":7513,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":405,"end_offset":414},{"id":7514,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":628,"end_offset":637},{"id":7515,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":762,"end_offset":771}],"relations":[{"id":3264,"from_id":7510,"to_id":7511,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3265,"from_id":7510,"to_id":7512,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3266,"from_id":7515,"to_id":7516,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

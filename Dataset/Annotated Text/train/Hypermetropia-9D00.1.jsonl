{"id":1533,"text":"#Overview - Hypermetropia - 9D00.1\nHypermetropia (hyperopia, long-sightedness or far- sightedness) is a form of refractive error in which parallel rays of light coming from infinity are focused behind the light sensitive layer of the retina, when the eye is at rest. Donders (1864) discusses in his historical review about hypermetropia. Much of the problem was caused by confusion between the effects of presbyopia and hypermetropia on near vision. Small hypermetropia may be corrected by voluntary accommodation. Even high errors of refraction may be corrected this way, but convex glasses may be required if symptoms are not relieved.","entities":[{"id":20877,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":26},{"id":20878,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":35,"end_offset":49},{"id":20880,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":323,"end_offset":336},{"id":20881,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":372,"end_offset":448},{"id":20879,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":112,"end_offset":240},{"id":20882,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":450,"end_offset":469}],"relations":[{"id":10401,"from_id":20878,"to_id":20879,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

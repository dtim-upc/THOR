{"id":1368,"text":"#Overview - Guillain Barre syndrome - 8C01.0\nGuillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare disorder of the peripheral nervous system. GBS is an autoimmune disorder in which a person’s own immune system attacks healthy nerve cells in peripheral nervous system. The syndrome can affect the nerves that control muscle movement and nerves that transmit feelings of pain, temperature and touch. This leads to muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling and sometimes paralysis. The cause of this condition is unknown, but it’s typically triggered by an infectious illness, such as the gastrointestinal infection or a lung infection.","entities":[{"id":19167,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":35},{"id":19168,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":45,"end_offset":74},{"id":19169,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":85,"end_offset":126},{"id":19170,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":128,"end_offset":132},{"id":19171,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":138,"end_offset":252},{"id":19173,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":282,"end_offset":382},{"id":19174,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":398,"end_offset":413},{"id":19176,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":429,"end_offset":461},{"id":19172,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":254,"end_offset":266},{"id":19175,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":415,"end_offset":423},{"id":19177,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":538,"end_offset":616},{"id":19178,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":507,"end_offset":512}],"relations":[{"id":9399,"from_id":19178,"to_id":19177,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9396,"from_id":19168,"to_id":19169,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":9398,"from_id":19172,"to_id":19173,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":9397,"from_id":19170,"to_id":19171,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

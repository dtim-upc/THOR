General Factors – Heredity, congenital defects such as cleft lip and palate, environment (prenatal and postnatal), habits like thumb sucking or finger sucking, lip or nail biting, tongue thrusting, respiratory problem like mouth breathing, trauma and accidents. 2. Local Factors includes- Abnormality in tooth shape, size and number; premature tooth loss, prolonged tooth retention, delayed eruption of permanent teeth, premature tooth loss. Most often it occurs in children whose parents have malocclusion. When children have less or no space between their primary\/baby teeth, they are at risk of having malocclusion, because the permanent teeth are larger and require more space.","entities":[{"id":20236,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":183,"end_offset":219},{"id":20240,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":304,"end_offset":344},{"id":20242,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":346,"end_offset":352},{"id":20248,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":395,"end_offset":438},{"id":20252,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":489,"end_offset":524},{"id":20253,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":526,"end_offset":546},{"id":20255,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":572,"end_offset":612},{"id":20257,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":619,"end_offset":682},{"id":20232,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":22},{"id":20233,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":53,"end_offset":65},{"id":20234,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":124,"end_offset":181},{"id":20237,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":221,"end_offset":264},{"id":20238,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":266,"end_offset":284},{"id":20239,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":287,"end_offset":302},{"id":20243,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":357,"end_offset":366},{"id":20250,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":440,"end_offset":460},{"id":20251,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":462,"end_offset":487},{"id":20258,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":711,"end_offset":723}],"relations":[{"id":10024,"from_id":20233,"to_id":20234,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10028,"from_id":20233,"to_id":20239,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10030,"from_id":20233,"to_id":20242,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10079,"from_id":20232,"to_id":20248,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10080,"from_id":20232,"to_id":20250,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10082,"from_id":20232,"to_id":20252,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10083,"from_id":20232,"to_id":20253,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10025,"from_id":20233,"to_id":20236,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10026,"from_id":20233,"to_id":20237,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10027,"from_id":20233,"to_id":20238,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10029,"from_id":20233,"to_id":20240,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10031,"from_id":20233,"to_id":20243,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10032,"from_id":20258,"to_id":20257,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":10081,"from_id":20232,"to_id":20251,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10084,"from_id":20232,"to_id":20255,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1461,"text":"#Treatment - Malocclusion - DA0E.5Z\nMisaligned teeth (Malocclusion) require orthodontic treatment. Orthodontics is a branch of dentistry which manages the growth and correction of dental and facial structures. Treatment may require removable or fixed appliances (commonly known as braces). Braces apply gentle and constant force to change tooth positions slowly and align them properly with the opposing teeth. Additional efforts and care is required to maintain oral hygiene while wearing braces. Rinsing, brushing and flossing should be done immediately after eating. In case of crowding, extraction of one or more teeth may be required to create space and align the teeth. Space maintainers are required to maintain space for permanent tooth in place of prematurely lost tooth, until the permanent tooth is not erupted. Severe malocclusions or complicated cases may also require surgical intervention. Retainers are given to the patient to stabilize the teeth in the desired new position, after completion of the treatment. Sometimes night guards are given to prevent teeth grinding and to ease stress on jaws.","entities":[{"id":20306,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":25},{"id":20307,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":54,"end_offset":66},{"id":20309,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":76,"end_offset":97},{"id":20311,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":339,"end_offset":344},{"id":20313,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":823,"end_offset":843},{"id":20314,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":882,"end_offset":903},{"id":20315,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":957,"end_offset":962},{"id":20308,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":36,"end_offset":52},{"id":20310,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":99,"end_offset":111},{"id":20312,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":290,"end_offset":296},{"id":20319,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1037,"end_offset":1049},{"id":20320,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1071,"end_offset":1076},{"id":20322,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1098,"end_offset":1112}],"relations":[{"id":10069,"from_id":20309,"to_id":20307,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":10071,"from_id":20314,"to_id":20313,"type":"surgery_for_R"},{"id":10070,"from_id":20309,"to_id":20308,"type":"prescribed_for_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":998,"text":"#Treatment - Fibroids - 2E86.0\nMedicines that are used to treat heavy periods are: Tranexamic acid is prescribed for 3-4 times a day. It works by reducing the breakdown of blood clots in the womb. Anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen and mefenamic acid. These also help to ease period pain. They are taken for a few days at the time of   period. They work by reducing the high level of a chemical (prostaglandin) in the lining of the uterus  . Prostaglandin seems to contribute to heavy and painful periods. Medication to shrink the fibroids: Women are  given a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue. This is a hormonal medicine that leads to low level of estrogen in body. Fibroids shrink if the level of estrogen falls. However, a low estrogen level can cause symptoms similar to the menopause (hot flushes, etc). These medications may also increase the risk of osteoporosis. Therefore this treatment is given for a maximum period of six months. GnRH analogues, such as goserelin (eg Zoladex®) or leuprorelin acetate (eg Prostap® SR), are often prescribed for three to four months before having an operation, which will make it easier to remove fibroids. Sometimes a low dose of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is also given to reduce the incidence of menopausal side-effects. A new medication treatment undergoing trials: A medicine called ulipristal acetate (UPA) has shown promise in preliminary research trials. This is currently used as an emergency contraceptive. It works by blocking the effects of the hormone progestogen. Progestogen is thought to play a role in fibroid development and so it was thought that this medicine may help to shrink fibroids. A small research trial has concluded that it does seem to have an effect on shrinking fibroids, with side-effects not being too troublesome. Further larger clinical trials are needed to establish whether this is indeed a good treatment option. Surgery and other operative treatments: There are several different operations available to remove and treat fibroids. Hysterectomy: This is the traditional and most common treatment for fibroids. Hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus. Myomectomy: This is a possible alternative, especially in women who may wish to have children in the future. In this operation, the fibroids are removed and the uterus is left. This procedure is not always possible. Endometrial ablation: This procedure involves removing the lining of the womb. This can be done by different methods  for example, using laser energy, a heated wire loop or by microwave heating. This method is usually recommended for fibroids close to the inner lining of the uterus NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health.

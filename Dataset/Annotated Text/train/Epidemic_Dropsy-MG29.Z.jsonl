{"id":958,"text":"#Causes - Epidemic Dropsy - MG29.Z\nEpidemic dropsy is a clinical state caused by consuming the edible oil adulterated with Argemone mexicana seed oil that is a native plant of the West Indies, and grows wild in India. It has prickly leaves and bright yellow flowers. In India it is popularly known as Satyanashi. Seeds of Argemone mexicana are black in colour and closely resemble mustard seeds. Crops of mustard oil are matured during March and at the same time seeds of argemone also mature hence there may be accidental mixing of both seeds. However intentional mixing of Argemone mexicana oil with mustard oil by unscrupulous traders can lead to large scale outbreaks. Toxic effects of argemone oil are because of two physiologically active (benzophenanthridine) alkaloids-sanguinarine and dihydro-sanguinarine. Sanguinarine interferes with the oxidation of pyruvic acid that accumulates in the blood. The outbreaks of epidemic dropsy occur usually in months of May to September in India because newly extracted oil is sold during these months in the market. Massage with contaminated mustard oil has also been reported to cause epidemic dropsy.","entities":[{"id":14023,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":25},{"id":14024,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":35,"end_offset":50},{"id":14025,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":81,"end_offset":216},{"id":14026,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":301,"end_offset":311},{"id":14027,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":553,"end_offset":637},{"id":14028,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":722,"end_offset":789},{"id":14029,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":794,"end_offset":814},{"id":14030,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":816,"end_offset":828},{"id":14031,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":899,"end_offset":904},{"id":14032,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":923,"end_offset":938},{"id":14033,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1063,"end_offset":1100},{"id":14034,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1133,"end_offset":1148}],"relations":[{"id":6703,"from_id":14024,"to_id":14025,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":6704,"from_id":14034,"to_id":14033,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":6705,"from_id":14023,"to_id":14026,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":6706,"from_id":14023,"to_id":14027,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":6707,"from_id":14023,"to_id":14028,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":6708,"from_id":14023,"to_id":14029,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":6709,"from_id":14023,"to_id":14030,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":960,"text":"#Diagnosis - Epidemic Dropsy - MG29.Z\nThe diagnosis of epidemic dropsy may be considered during an outbreak of bilateral tender pitting leg oedema in more than one member of a family or community. It should be distinguished from hypoproteinaemic states, filariasis, venous insufficiency, Beriberi, hypothyroidism and nephrotic syndrome. Presence of sanguinarine in blood and urine confirms the diagnosis for epidemic dropsy. Blood examination: may show anaemia and pancytopenia, raised plasma pyruvate levels and presence of sanguinarine. Liver function tests: are usually normal. Kidney function tests: blood urea and creatinine may be raised if renal failure is present. Hypoalbuminaemia, raised alpha-2 globulin and reversal of albumin: globulin ratio may be found in some cases. Urinalysis: is usually normal but sanguinarine may be present. Chest X-ray: may show cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema or pneumonia. Electrocardiogram: may show nonspecific ST segment, and T-wave changes or atrial or ventricular extrasystoles. Detection of argemone oil adulteration in edible oils: Nitric acid test:  Nitric acid is added to the sample of oil in a test tube. The test tube is shaken and development of yellow, orange-yellow or crimson colour shows the presence of argemone oil. The test is positive only when the concentration of argemone oil is >0.25%.

Persons of all ages were affected except breastfed infants and small children who have no mustard oil in their diets. Onset is usually insidious with watery diarrhoea and vomiting. This may last from a few days to more than a week. Intermittent or continuous fever, ranging from 99°F to 100.5°F, usually not high grade Joint pains, muscular pains, and low backache. Bilateral pitting oedema of the lower limbs extending from the ankles up to the scrotum and abdominal wall. Oedema increases after standing, typically reaching a maximum at the end of the day and decreasing on lying down. Erythema and skin tenderness. Cough and breathlessness, initially on exertion, later on breathlessness may be present at rest and on lying down when cardiac failure develops. Hepatomegaly (enlargement of liver). Eyes: fundus examination shows dilated, torturous vessels and superficial retinal haemorrhages.

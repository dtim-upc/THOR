{"id":1742,"text":"#Diagnosis - Monkeypox - 1E71\nMonkeypox must be clinically differentiated from other rash illnesses, such as chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, syphilis, herpes simplex virus, molluscum contagiosum virus, enterovirus, parapoxviruses (causing orf and related conditions), chancroid and medication associated allergies. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) during the prodromal stage of monkeypox can distinguish it from chickenpox or smallpox. Any individual that meets the suspected case definition for monkeypox should be tested. Detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the preferred laboratory test for monkeypox. A recent or remote vaccination with a vaccinia-based vaccine (e.g. anyone vaccinated before smallpox eradication, or more recently vaccinated due to higher risk such as orthopoxvirus laboratory personnel) may show false-positive results.","entities":[{"id":23236,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":23},{"id":23237,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":30,"end_offset":40},{"id":23238,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":109,"end_offset":119},{"id":23242,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":166,"end_offset":174},{"id":23243,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":176,"end_offset":196},{"id":23244,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":198,"end_offset":225},{"id":23246,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":240,"end_offset":255},{"id":23248,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":340,"end_offset":377},{"id":23249,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":408,"end_offset":418},{"id":23250,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":442,"end_offset":464},{"id":23251,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":526,"end_offset":536},{"id":23239,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":121,"end_offset":128},{"id":23240,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":130,"end_offset":155},{"id":23241,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":157,"end_offset":164},{"id":23245,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":227,"end_offset":238},{"id":23247,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":293,"end_offset":338},{"id":23252,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":649,"end_offset":658},{"id":23253,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":554,"end_offset":611},{"id":23254,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":660,"end_offset":720}],"relations":[{"id":11754,"from_id":23237,"to_id":23238,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11755,"from_id":23237,"to_id":23239,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11756,"from_id":23237,"to_id":23240,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11757,"from_id":23237,"to_id":23241,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11758,"from_id":23237,"to_id":23242,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11759,"from_id":23237,"to_id":23243,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11760,"from_id":23237,"to_id":23244,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11765,"from_id":23249,"to_id":23250,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11766,"from_id":23249,"to_id":23248,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11767,"from_id":23252,"to_id":23253,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":11768,"from_id":23236,"to_id":23254,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":11761,"from_id":23237,"to_id":23245,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11762,"from_id":23237,"to_id":23246,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11763,"from_id":23237,"to_id":23247,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

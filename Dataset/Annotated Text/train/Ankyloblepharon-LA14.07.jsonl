{"id":389,"text":"#Overview - Ankyloblepharon - LA14.07\nAnkyloblepharon is defined as adhesion of the edges of upper eyelid with the lower eyelid. The eyelids maintain their integrity and identity. The condition is usually congenital but may be acquired. In congenital ankyloblepharon, the fused eyelids fail to separate completely during development of embryo. Congenital ankyloblepharon is caused by developmental arrest leading to aberration in growth at either medial or lateral canthus. It may occur as a sporadic finding or in association with chromosomal\/syndromic conditions. Ankyloblepharon may also develop following: chemical injuries to the eyes, Trauma, Cicatrising diseases such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or cicatricial ocular pemphigoid, Inflammatory diseases such as herpes simplex infection or ulcerative blepharitis.","entities":[{"id":7034,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":27},{"id":7035,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":38,"end_offset":53},{"id":7036,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":68,"end_offset":127},{"id":7037,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":129,"end_offset":140},{"id":7038,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":180,"end_offset":193},{"id":7039,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":240,"end_offset":266},{"id":7040,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":272,"end_offset":302},{"id":7041,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":344,"end_offset":370},{"id":7042,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":384,"end_offset":472},{"id":7043,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":532,"end_offset":564},{"id":7044,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":474,"end_offset":476},{"id":7045,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":566,"end_offset":581},{"id":7046,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":610,"end_offset":639},{"id":7047,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":641,"end_offset":647},{"id":7048,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":649,"end_offset":735},{"id":7049,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":737,"end_offset":817}],"relations":[{"id":3038,"from_id":7035,"to_id":7036,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3039,"from_id":7039,"to_id":7040,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3040,"from_id":7041,"to_id":7042,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3041,"from_id":7044,"to_id":7043,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3042,"from_id":7045,"to_id":7046,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3043,"from_id":7045,"to_id":7047,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3044,"from_id":7045,"to_id":7048,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3045,"from_id":7045,"to_id":7049,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":390,"text":"#Treatment - Ankyloblepharon - LA14.07\nTreatment should be carried out under medical supervision. Indications for therapy in cases of congenital and acquired cases of ankyloblepharon are similar. Presence of a significant central ankyloblepharon may occlude vision. In congenital type, it may potentially cause an occlusion type amblyopia. A significant nasal or temporal ankyloblepharon may restrict peripheral vision. Normal opening and closing of eyes may also be affected. Surgical therapy: A potential contraindication to ankyloblepharon surgery is the problem of corneal exposure following release of marginal adhesions.

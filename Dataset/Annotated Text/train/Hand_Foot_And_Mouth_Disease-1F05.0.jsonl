{"id":1519,"text":"#Symptoms - Hand Foot And Mouth Disease - 1F05.0\nHFMD is usually a mild disease. Symptoms may appear in 3-7 days after getting infection (this period is termed as incubation period). The first symptom is fever lasting for 24-48 hours, with poor appetite, malaise and sore throat. One or two days after fever onset, painful sores appear on the tongue, gums and inside the cheeks. A non-itchy rash develops over one to two days on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet; may appear on the buttocks and \/or genitalia. Some persons with HFMD may not show any symptoms or may have only rash or only mouth ulcers. HFMD in pregnant women: No adverse outcome of pregnancy (such as abortion, stillbirth or congenital defects) is observed when pregnant women are infected with HFMD. Most newborns infected with an enterovirus have mild illness, but the risk of severe illness may be higher in newborns infected during the first two weeks of life.","entities":[{"id":20691,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":39},{"id":20693,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":204,"end_offset":278},{"id":20695,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":379,"end_offset":519},{"id":20699,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":773,"end_offset":777},{"id":20700,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":793,"end_offset":839},{"id":20692,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":49,"end_offset":54},{"id":20694,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":280,"end_offset":377},{"id":20696,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":521,"end_offset":612},{"id":20697,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":614,"end_offset":619},{"id":20698,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":638,"end_offset":722}],"relations":[{"id":10296,"from_id":20691,"to_id":20693,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":10299,"from_id":20691,"to_id":20696,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":10297,"from_id":20691,"to_id":20694,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":10298,"from_id":20691,"to_id":20695,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":10300,"from_id":20697,"to_id":20698,"type":"has_symptom_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":421,"text":"#Causes - Amblyopia - 9D46\nA distinction must be made between potentially reversible functional amblyopia and irreversible organic amblyopia. Organic amblyopia is a term used to describe visual impairment due to obvious or non obvious ocular pathology, commonly affecting retina or optic nerve. Examples of organic amblyopia are optic nerve hypoplasia, optic atrophy and foveal hypoplasia. Functional amblyopia may occur along with organic amblyopia. Functional amblyopia normally occurs in an eye that is anatomically normal. Functional amblyopia is caused by either form of vision deprivation or abnormal binocular interaction. Form- vision deprivation occurs due to conditions that obstruct the visual axis such as cataract, corneal opacity, vitreous haemorrhage, or severe ptosis, but it may also be produced by severe anisometropia. Abnormal binocular interaction refers to the condition in which the image projected onto the fovea of each eye is dissimilar enough to preclude fusion, thus prompting suppression and ultimately amblyopia of the suppressed eye. While strabismus may be the most obvious cause of abnormal binocular interaction, unilateral opacity of the media and anisometropia may participate in this mechanism as well.

{"id":424,"text":"#Overview - Amblyopia - 9D46\nAmblyopia is often defined as a difference in visual acuity of two lines or more on Snellen or equivalent chart in a child with, otherwise, healthy eyes. Amblyopia may be present any time visual acuity is reduced, and the reduction of acuity cannot be explained by findings on clinical examination, even if the difference is even one line only. Amblyopia is a functional reduction in the visual acuity of an eye caused by disuse during critical period of visual development. The mechanism of vision loss is not known, but it is thought to originate in the visual cortex. Amblyopia results in reduced visual acuity, binocularity, depth perception, and contrast sensitivity. Fusion and stereopsis, the central formation of three dimensional images, are dependent upon receiving clear images from each eye simultaneously.","entities":[{"id":7608,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":22},{"id":7617,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":183,"end_offset":193},{"id":7612,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":29,"end_offset":39},{"id":7622,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":306,"end_offset":326},{"id":7999,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":374,"end_offset":384},{"id":8000,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":451,"end_offset":502},{"id":8001,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":600,"end_offset":610}],"relations":[{"id":3539,"from_id":7999,"to_id":8000,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":425,"text":"#Treatment - Amblyopia - 9D46\nEarly management of amblyopia is critical for best visual acuity results. The basic strategy for treating amblyopia is to first provide a clear retinal image, and then correct ocular dominance if ocular dominance is present, as early as possible during the period of visual plasticity (birth to eight years of life). I. Clear retinal image: Patients with bilateral hypermetropia (> + 5.00 D) should receive the full hypermetropic correction, as amblyopic eyes do not fully accommodate. Patients who are given partial correction of their high hypermetropia often shows very slow or no improvement in their amblyopia. Prescribe full astigmatic correction to provide a clear retinal image. II. Correct ocular dominance: Correction of ocular dominance is accomplished by forcing fixation to the amblyopic eye through patching or blurring the vision of the sound eye by: Occlusion, Penalisation, Occlusive contact lens, Bilateral light occlusion, Levodopa\/ carbidopa in the treatment of amblyopia, Pleoptics, Active stimulation. Prognosis: The prognosis of amblyopia depends upon the age of the patient, severity of amblyopia, and type of amblyopia. The earlier the amblyopia occurs and longer it remains untreated, the worse is the prognosis. In general, bilateral amblyopia responds better than unilateral amblyopia, and myopic anisometropic amblyopia responds better than hypermetropic anisometropic amblyopia.","entities":[{"id":8002,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":23},{"id":8003,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":50,"end_offset":60},{"id":8004,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":136,"end_offset":146},{"id":8005,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":475,"end_offset":489},{"id":8006,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":567,"end_offset":585},{"id":8007,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":635,"end_offset":644},{"id":8008,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":821,"end_offset":834},{"id":8009,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":350,"end_offset":369},{"id":8010,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":721,"end_offset":745},{"id":8013,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":896,"end_offset":905},{"id":8015,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":921,"end_offset":943},{"id":8017,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":972,"end_offset":1021},{"id":8014,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":907,"end_offset":919},{"id":8016,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":945,"end_offset":970},{"id":8019,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1034,"end_offset":1052},{"id":8022,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1082,"end_offset":1092},{"id":8023,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1141,"end_offset":1150},{"id":8024,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1164,"end_offset":1173},{"id":8027,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1281,"end_offset":1300},{"id":8030,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1400,"end_offset":1437},{"id":8026,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1258,"end_offset":1267},{"id":8018,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1023,"end_offset":1032},{"id":8020,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1054,"end_offset":1063},{"id":8021,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1069,"end_offset":1079},{"id":8025,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1191,"end_offset":1201},{"id":8028,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1322,"end_offset":1342},{"id":8029,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1348,"end_offset":1378}],"relations":[{"id":3544,"from_id":8002,"to_id":8009,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3545,"from_id":8002,"to_id":8010,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3546,"from_id":8013,"to_id":8002,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":3547,"from_id":8014,"to_id":8002,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":3548,"from_id":8015,"to_id":8002,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":3549,"from_id":8016,"to_id":8002,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":3550,"from_id":8017,"to_id":8002,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":3551,"from_id":8018,"to_id":8002,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":3552,"from_id":8019,"to_id":8002,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":3553,"from_id":8021,"to_id":8022,"type":"prescribed_for_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":450,"text":"#Diagnosis - Amblyopia - 9D46\nDiagnosis of amblyopia is based mainly on measurement of visual acuity. Visual acuity measurement: Subjective and objective methods to test visual acuity have been proposed. Optical grating: The different stimuli consist of repetitive gratings of predictable and precise luminance variations. Sinusoidal and square- wave gratings are some other forms to test visual acuity. Optokinetic nystagmus: The primary use of optokinetic nystagmus is a rapid screen for the gross integrity of the visual system. Acuity may be measured as the finest grating that elicits a visible optokinetic nystagmus when different sizes of stripes are used. Preferential looking test: It is based on the principle that infants tend to fixate a pattern stimulus rather than a homogeneous field. With this, inter-ocular acuity may be detected in children less than one year of age. Visually evoked potential: Visually evoked potential is a summed cortical response to changes in some characteristics of a visual stimulus. The visual stimulus may be either a simple flash or a more complex pattern. Visuscope: Visuscope is a type of direct ophthalmoscope that projects a focused image onto the retina so that the examiner can see the image on the retina.","entities":[{"id":8051,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":23},{"id":8052,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":43,"end_offset":53},{"id":8053,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":204,"end_offset":219},{"id":8054,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":404,"end_offset":425},{"id":8055,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":664,"end_offset":689},{"id":8056,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":886,"end_offset":911},{"id":8057,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1102,"end_offset":1111},{"id":8058,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":446,"end_offset":467},{"id":8059,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":600,"end_offset":621},{"id":8060,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":913,"end_offset":938},{"id":8061,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1113,"end_offset":1123}],"relations":[{"id":3564,"from_id":8051,"to_id":8053,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3565,"from_id":8051,"to_id":8054,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3566,"from_id":8051,"to_id":8055,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3567,"from_id":8051,"to_id":8056,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3568,"from_id":8051,"to_id":8057,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":687,"text":"#Causes - Commotio Retina - NA06.62\nCommotio retinae is caused due to pressure waves emanating from blunt trauma to the eye resulting in retinal injury. There may also be associated choroidal rupture or retinal haemorrhage. Following acute episode of oedema, retina may develop scarring and pigment dispersal. Macular commotio retinae reduces central vision. The vision usually improves on resolution of oedema, unless there is development of macular hole or disruption of retinal pigment epithelium of the fovea. Studies suggest that commotio retinae is probably caused due to disruption of the photoreceptor outer segments, and is not a true extracellular oedema.","entities":[{"id":11117,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":251,"end_offset":257},{"id":11119,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":278,"end_offset":286},{"id":11120,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":291,"end_offset":308},{"id":11118,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":259,"end_offset":265},{"id":11121,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":310,"end_offset":334},{"id":11122,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":390,"end_offset":410},{"id":11016,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":25},{"id":11123,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":473,"end_offset":499},{"id":11126,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":596,"end_offset":609},{"id":11127,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":644,"end_offset":664},{"id":11017,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":36,"end_offset":52},{"id":11018,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":70,"end_offset":123},{"id":11019,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":137,"end_offset":151},{"id":11020,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":182,"end_offset":222},{"id":11124,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":507,"end_offset":512},{"id":11125,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":535,"end_offset":551}],"relations":[{"id":5153,"from_id":11017,"to_id":11019,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":5154,"from_id":11017,"to_id":11018,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5205,"from_id":11016,"to_id":11117,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5206,"from_id":11016,"to_id":11121,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":688,"text":"#Diagnosis - Commotio Retina - NA06.62\nDiagnosis depends upon the history of injury to the eye and clinical features.

Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA): Fundus Fluorescein Angiography may show early blockage in areas of white retina and no alteration in vascular permeability. There may be leakage of fluorescein dye with associated retinal pigment epithelium changes. A ‘salt and pepper’ fundus may be seen in cases with more severe injury.

The patient should be observed closely during first few days to weeks following trauma, to monitor development of any complication and its treatment thereof.

Prognosis: Most patients recover spontaneously, but some with more severe trauma may remain visually impaired with reduced vision or paracentral scotoma. Most of the cases resolve within four weeks of injury, although some improvement may continue for up to even six weeks. Some patients have permanent macular damage with absolute or relative scotoma.

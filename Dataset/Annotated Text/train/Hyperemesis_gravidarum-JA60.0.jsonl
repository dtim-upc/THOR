{"id":1875,"text":"#Treatment - Hyperemesis gravidarum - JA60.0\nFor nausea and vomiting in pregnancy women may usually not seek help because of concerns about the safety of medications. However, the experts note that treating nausea and vomiting early in pregnancy, before it progresses, can help control symptoms and prevent more serious complications, including hospitalization. Management includes non-pharmacologic therapies and pharmacologic therapies. Non-pharmacologic therapies- Sometimes diet and lifestyle changes are sufficient to manage nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. These include- Avoidance of stimuli that provoke nausea and vomiting such as strong odors, heat and noises that trigger the labyrinthine areas. Dietary counseling about frequent small meals and avoidance of spicy or fatty foods. Use of Ginger (ginger tea made from fresh grated ginger, ginger capsules, and ginger candies). Try bland foods, (such as the BRATT diet -bananas, rice, apple sauce, toast, and tea). Drink fluids often. Take a multivitamin that does not contain iron or take folic acid alone in first trimester. Eat light food in morning something like dry toast or a plain biscuit before getting up to avoid moving around on an empty stomach. Pharmacologic therapies- If diet and lifestyle changes do not help to reduce symptoms, or if there is severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, medical treatment may be needed. When other medical conditions are ruled out, certain medications can be given by medical expert to treat nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: Vitamin B6 and doxylamine, both drugs taken alone or together have been found to be safe to take during pregnancy and have no harmful effects on the baby. Antiemetic drugs (drugs preventing vomiting): If vitamin B6 and doxylamine combination is not effective, antiemetic drugs may be prescribed by doctor considering the severity of symptoms and safety of drug to use during pregnancy. Women who cannot tolerate oral liquids for a prolonged period or who have clinical signs of dehydration should receive intravenous hydration including dextrose and vitamins.

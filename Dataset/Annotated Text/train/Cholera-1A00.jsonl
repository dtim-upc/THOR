{"id":538,"text":"#Causes - Cholera - 1A00\nCholera is a diarrheal illness caused by the bacteria Vibrio cholerae. This species is not common to humans, and its presence in the human digestive system is not part of the natural life cycle of the bacteria. A person can get infected by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the cholera bacterium. In an epidemic, the source of the contamination is usually the faeces of an infected person that contaminates water and\/or food. The disease can spread rapidly in areas with inadequate treatment of sewage and drinking water. The disease is not likely to spread directly from one person to another therefore, casual contact with an infected person is not a risk for becoming ill.","entities":[{"id":9167,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":17},{"id":9168,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":25,"end_offset":32},{"id":9172,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":510,"end_offset":559},{"id":9169,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":70,"end_offset":94},{"id":9170,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":317,"end_offset":334},{"id":9171,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":465,"end_offset":476}],"relations":[{"id":4131,"from_id":9168,"to_id":9169,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4133,"from_id":9167,"to_id":9170,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4132,"from_id":9171,"to_id":9172,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":540,"text":"#Overview - Cholera - 1A00\nCholera is an intestinal infection which is caused when a person consumes contaminated food or water. It is generally caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It has a short incubation period, from one day to five days. After contamination, bacteria produces an enterotoxin that causes a copious, painless, watery diarrhea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not promptly given. Vomiting also occurs in most patients. The cholera bacteria are generally seen in water or food sources, that have been contaminated by faeces from a person infected with cholera. Cholera is usually seen in places with inadequate water treatment, poor sanitation and inadequate hygiene. The cholera bacterium may also live in the environment in salty rivers and coastal waters.","entities":[{"id":9179,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":19},{"id":9180,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":27,"end_offset":34},{"id":9181,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":101,"end_offset":127},{"id":9184,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":129,"end_offset":131},{"id":9186,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":324,"end_offset":332},{"id":9183,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":159,"end_offset":184},{"id":9185,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":315,"end_offset":322},{"id":9188,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":341,"end_offset":349},{"id":9189,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":289,"end_offset":300},{"id":9187,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":334,"end_offset":340},{"id":9191,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":440,"end_offset":448},{"id":9193,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":483,"end_offset":499},{"id":9194,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":522,"end_offset":618},{"id":9195,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":620,"end_offset":627},{"id":9197,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":731,"end_offset":748}],"relations":[{"id":4139,"from_id":9180,"to_id":9181,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4141,"from_id":9193,"to_id":9194,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4140,"from_id":9184,"to_id":9183,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

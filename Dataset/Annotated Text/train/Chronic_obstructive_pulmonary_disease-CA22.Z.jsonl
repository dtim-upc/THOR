COPD is confirmed by a diagnostic test called \"spirometry\". It measures how much air a person can inhale and exhale, and how fast air can move into and out of the lungs. Because COPD develops slowly, it is frequently diagnosed in people aged 40 or older. Where spirometry is unavailable, clinical symptoms and signs, such as abnormal shortness of breath and increased forced expiratory time, can be used to help with the diagnosis. Chronic cough and sputum production often precede the development of airflow limitation by many years; although not all individuals with cough and sputum production go on to develop COPD.","entities":[{"id":10705,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":50},{"id":10707,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":136,"end_offset":149},{"id":10708,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":151,"end_offset":168},{"id":10709,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":170,"end_offset":179},{"id":10711,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":271,"end_offset":276},{"id":10712,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":318,"end_offset":328},{"id":10715,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":596,"end_offset":661},{"id":10718,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":885,"end_offset":889},{"id":10706,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":73,"end_offset":78},{"id":10710,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":218,"end_offset":269},{"id":10713,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":449,"end_offset":454},{"id":10714,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":532,"end_offset":543},{"id":10716,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":703,"end_offset":716},{"id":10717,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":721,"end_offset":738}],"relations":[{"id":4953,"from_id":10706,"to_id":10709,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":4955,"from_id":10711,"to_id":10712,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4952,"from_id":10706,"to_id":10708,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":4951,"from_id":10706,"to_id":10707,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":4954,"from_id":10706,"to_id":10710,"type":"has_symptom_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1932,"text":"#Causes - Presbyopia - 9D00.3\nPresbyopia is caused due to loss of the fine balance of forces that permit the accommodative structures to bring a change in optical power of the lens in the young eye. With advancing age, there is decline in the ability of the eye to accommodate or change its focus. Neural pathway for accommodation: Accommodation is associated with convergence and miosis forming the triad of ‘near reflex’. The neural pathway for accommodation probably originates in the caudal part of the Edinger- Westphal or third nerve parasympathetic nucleus in the midbrain. These areas receive input from the cerebral cortex and pretectum. Fibers from the third nerve nucleus, responsible for accommodation, then travel to the ciliary ganglion, where they synapse with postganglionic parasympathetic fibers going to ciliary body and iris sphincter. Then via short ciliary nerves, they reach to the intrinsic muscles of the eye. Other causes of diminished near vision are: Uncorrected hypermetropia where all the accommodation is used for clear distant vision. Use of local or systemic parasympatholytic drugs (e.g.atropine). Aphakia and pseudo-phakia. Internal ophthalmoplegia. Pseudo-accommodative procedures: Mono-vision: Mono-vision refers to correcting dominant one eye to emmetropia and the other to myopia between minus 1 and minus 2 D, which can be achieved by excimer laser surgery. In hypermetropia, a steepening of the cornea with overcorrection of one eye may be performed by laser thermokeratoplasty (LTK). The limitation of mono-vision is the lack of a possibility for correction of intermediate distance vision without simultaneously affecting near and distance vision. Multifocal excimer laser: Multifocal corneal ablation with laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is currently used almost exclusively in hypermetropic and emmetropic eyes. Intra-corneal implants: Exact control of the lamellar corneal cut is obtained with microkeratome and femtosecond laser technologies. Benefit of these intra-corneal implants is their reversibility. If the implant is not well tolerated, or cataract surgery with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation is to be performed later, it can be removed, thereby restoring the original shape of the cornea.","entities":[{"id":25204,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":20},{"id":25206,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":58,"end_offset":197},{"id":25208,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":298,"end_offset":330},{"id":25209,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":424,"end_offset":460},{"id":25211,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":516,"end_offset":579},{"id":25214,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":865,"end_offset":885},{"id":25215,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":905,"end_offset":933},{"id":25205,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":30,"end_offset":40},{"id":25207,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":199,"end_offset":296},{"id":25210,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":507,"end_offset":514},{"id":25212,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":647,"end_offset":682},{"id":25213,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":823,"end_offset":835},{"id":25216,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":979,"end_offset":1065},{"id":25217,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1067,"end_offset":1130},{"id":25218,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1132,"end_offset":1157},{"id":25220,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1185,"end_offset":1216},{"id":25222,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1401,"end_offset":1414},{"id":25224,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1691,"end_offset":1715},{"id":25225,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1717,"end_offset":1795},{"id":25219,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1159,"end_offset":1183},{"id":25221,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1231,"end_offset":1396},{"id":25223,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1416,"end_offset":1524},{"id":25226,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1871,"end_offset":1893},{"id":25227,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":2256,"end_offset":2262}],"relations":[{"id":12873,"from_id":25205,"to_id":25206,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":12874,"from_id":25204,"to_id":25207,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":12879,"from_id":25204,"to_id":25218,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":12880,"from_id":25204,"to_id":25219,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":12882,"from_id":25204,"to_id":25221,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":12883,"from_id":25204,"to_id":25223,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":12884,"from_id":25204,"to_id":25224,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":12886,"from_id":25204,"to_id":25226,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":12875,"from_id":25204,"to_id":25208,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":12876,"from_id":25204,"to_id":25212,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":12877,"from_id":25204,"to_id":25216,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":12878,"from_id":25204,"to_id":25217,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":12881,"from_id":25204,"to_id":25220,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":12885,"from_id":25204,"to_id":25225,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":1933,"text":"#Diagnosis - Presbyopia - 9D00.3\nDiagnosing presbyopia is straightforward and age of the patient is a major consideration. A simple reading test using well- illuminated text of graded sizes at a standard distance may be helpful both in characterising the degree of near- vision and in determining the appropriate refractive power. Accommodation may be measured by determining the accommodative amplitude or the accommodative range. Monocular accommodative amplitude may be measured by following methods: Subjective push- up method: Subjective push- up method involves a small target (like near letter chart) being brought forward toward the eye until it blurs. It is the near point of accommodation. The reciprocal of the distance at which the target blurs is the accommodative amplitude in dioptres. Prince rule: Prince rule combines a scaled ruler with a near addition of + 3 D (dioptres), and it puts the far point of an emmetrope (a person with no refractive error) at 33 cm. The target on Prince rule is brought forward until it blurs. Taking account of addition of + 3, this distance is converted into dioptres of accommodative amplitude. Negative powered trial lenses: The test uses a distance letter chart and lenses of increasing minus spherical power to induce accommodation. More minus sphere is added until the subject can no longer overcome the minus lenses with accommodation. The amount of minus sphere that can be overcome represents the accommodative amplitude. Differential Diagnosis: Presbyopia is the most common cause of accommodative dysfunction. Presbyopia should be differentiated from other conditions with decreased accommodation like: Trauma along neuro-anatomical pathway: Trauma to the parasympathetic nuclei in the midbrain, to supra-nuclear structures, or to the third nerve may produce symptoms of asthenopia (eye strain). Adie’s syndrome: Adie’s syndrome is characterised by one eye with a pupil that is larger than normal and constricts slowly in bright light (tonic pupil), along with the absence of deep tendon reflexes, usually in the Achilles tendon. Adie’s syndrome is usually associated with decrease in accommodation. Pharmacological cycloplegia: Pharmacological cycloplegia also produces temporary accommodative dysfunction. Systemic medications: Systemic medications may cause decrease in accommodation. These medicines often have anti-cholinergic side effects. Examples include phenothiazines and anti-parkinsonian drugs. Unlike presbyopia, increased accommodation is rarely seen as in: Horner Syndrome: Several experiments have shown that ciliary body also receives sympathetic input. This is shown clinically by the increased accommodative amplitude seen in the affected eye of patients with Horner Syndrome . Miotic agents: Miotic agents such as pilocarpine may cause an abnormally proximal near point. Accommodative spasm: Accommodative spasm is a functional disorder characterised by blurred vision for distance, diplopia, episodic esotropia (inward turning of eye), miosis (small pupil), and an abnormal near point of accommodation.","entities":[{"id":25228,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":23},{"id":25229,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":44,"end_offset":54},{"id":25232,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":432,"end_offset":465},{"id":25234,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":801,"end_offset":812},{"id":25235,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":814,"end_offset":825},{"id":25230,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":123,"end_offset":144},{"id":25231,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":504,"end_offset":530},{"id":25233,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":532,"end_offset":558},{"id":25236,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":994,"end_offset":1005},{"id":25240,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1542,"end_offset":1567},{"id":25242,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1662,"end_offset":1699},{"id":25249,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":2089,"end_offset":2104},{"id":25250,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":2159,"end_offset":2186},{"id":25257,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":2422,"end_offset":2436},{"id":25259,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":2473,"end_offset":2483},{"id":25260,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":2531,"end_offset":2546},{"id":25261,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":2738,"end_offset":2753},{"id":25262,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":2756,"end_offset":2769},{"id":25263,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":2771,"end_offset":2784},{"id":25264,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":2850,"end_offset":2869},{"id":25265,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":2871,"end_offset":2890},{"id":25266,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":2933,"end_offset":2960},{"id":25237,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1145,"end_offset":1174},{"id":25238,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1176,"end_offset":1184},{"id":25239,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1503,"end_offset":1513},{"id":25241,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1569,"end_offset":1579},{"id":25243,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1701,"end_offset":1753},{"id":25244,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1830,"end_offset":1853},{"id":25245,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1855,"end_offset":1870},{"id":25246,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1872,"end_offset":1887},{"id":25247,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":2040,"end_offset":2046},{"id":25248,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":2072,"end_offset":2087},{"id":25251,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":2188,"end_offset":2215},{"id":25252,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":2240,"end_offset":2265},{"id":25253,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":2267,"end_offset":2287},{"id":25254,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":2289,"end_offset":2309},{"id":25255,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":2374,"end_offset":2403},{"id":25256,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":2347,"end_offset":2362},{"id":25258,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":2441,"end_offset":2464},{"id":25267,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":3045,"end_offset":3081},{"id":25268,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":2962,"end_offset":2970},{"id":25269,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":2972,"end_offset":3014}],"relations":[{"id":12887,"from_id":25228,"to_id":25230,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12889,"from_id":25228,"to_id":25234,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12890,"from_id":25228,"to_id":25237,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12892,"from_id":25241,"to_id":25242,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":12893,"from_id":25256,"to_id":25255,"type":"has_side_effect_R"},{"id":12888,"from_id":25228,"to_id":25231,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12891,"from_id":25239,"to_id":25240,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":1934,"text":"#Overview - Presbyopia - 9D00.3\nPresbyopia is the gradual age- related loss of accommodative amplitude which begins early in life and culminates in complete loss of accommodation by about 50 years of age. The word presbyopia is derived from the Greek words presbus (meaning old man) and ops (eye). Accommodation is a dynamic, optical change in the dioptric power of the eye allowing the point of focus of the eye to be changed from distant to near objects. Accommodation is the ability to increase the refractive power of the optical system of eye. It occurs to produce a clear image of near objects. For accommodation, the ciliary body contracts, the lens zonules relax, and the crystalline lens assumes a more spherical shape, which increases its refractive power. Other than presbyopia, disorders that affect accommodation are quite rare. Regardless of the cause, it causes blurred vision for near objects and there is eyestrain with prolonged near work.","entities":[{"id":25274,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":298,"end_offset":311},{"id":25281,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":867,"end_offset":869},{"id":25275,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":457,"end_offset":470},{"id":25276,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":370,"end_offset":373},{"id":25277,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":544,"end_offset":547},{"id":25278,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":605,"end_offset":618},{"id":25279,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":624,"end_offset":646},{"id":25280,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":778,"end_offset":788},{"id":25282,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":877,"end_offset":956},{"id":25270,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":22},{"id":25273,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":214,"end_offset":224},{"id":25272,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":32,"end_offset":42}],"relations":[{"id":12895,"from_id":25275,"to_id":25277,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":12897,"from_id":25281,"to_id":25282,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":12894,"from_id":25274,"to_id":25276,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":12896,"from_id":25278,"to_id":25279,"type":"influence_R"}],"Comments":[]}

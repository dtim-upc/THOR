{"id":636,"text":"#Diagnosis - birth defects - LD2Z\nFor the detection of congenital anomalies screening can be done during preconception period, during pregnancy and after child birth. Preconception screening: to identify those at risk of conceiving a child with a birth defect since inherited disorders tend to cluster within families. Peri-conception screening: offering genetic counseling to women 35 years or older. Along with routine ultrasound other tests can be used for screening during the first trimester and the second trimester of pregnancy. Nuchhal translucency test: with the help of ultrasound thickness of the area at the back of the neck (foetus) is measured. An increase in the thickness can be a sign of Down syndrome. First trimester blood test: high levels of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) hormone and low levels of pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) are related with certain birth defects. Triple screen test\/ quad screening: The triple screen test is a maternal blood screening test that involves three specific substances: Alpha-fetoprotein test (AFP), human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), and estriol estimation. Anomaly Ultrasound: The ultrasound is used to know about different parameters of foetus and looks for any birth defects. Amniocentesis: during pregnancy foetus is surrounded by amniotic fluid that can be used to detect genetic disorders in the foetus. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS): in this test cells from the chorionic villi (tissues from placenta) are examined for chromosomal disorders such as Down syndromes. Cell-free fetal DNA: It is a noninvasive prenatal screening that uses cell-free DNA from the plasma of pregnant women as a screening method for fetal aneuploidy. Cordocentesis: also called percutaneous umbilical blood sampling, a small sample of the foetal blood is withdrawn from the umbilical cord for detection of foetal abnormalities after 17 weeks of pregnancy.","entities":[{"id":10349,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1167,"end_offset":1181},{"id":10352,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1268,"end_offset":1281},{"id":10353,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1300,"end_offset":1306},{"id":10355,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1391,"end_offset":1397},{"id":10354,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1366,"end_offset":1383},{"id":10359,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1547,"end_offset":1561},{"id":10360,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1563,"end_offset":1582},{"id":10363,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1725,"end_offset":1738},{"id":10364,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1752,"end_offset":1789},{"id":10356,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1399,"end_offset":1430},{"id":10357,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1445,"end_offset":1450},{"id":10358,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1460,"end_offset":1499},{"id":10361,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1643,"end_offset":1646},{"id":10362,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1707,"end_offset":1723},{"id":10365,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1848,"end_offset":1862},{"id":10366,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1881,"end_offset":1900},{"id":10328,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":26},{"id":10329,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":55,"end_offset":75},{"id":10330,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":76,"end_offset":85},{"id":10331,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":167,"end_offset":190},{"id":10332,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":247,"end_offset":259},{"id":10333,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":266,"end_offset":285},{"id":10334,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":319,"end_offset":344},{"id":10335,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":421,"end_offset":431},{"id":10336,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":438,"end_offset":443},{"id":10338,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":536,"end_offset":561},{"id":10337,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":460,"end_offset":469},{"id":10339,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":580,"end_offset":590},{"id":10341,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":705,"end_offset":718},{"id":10342,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":659,"end_offset":687},{"id":10343,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":720,"end_offset":746},{"id":10347,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":985,"end_offset":1014},{"id":10348,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1147,"end_offset":1165},{"id":10350,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1228,"end_offset":1234},{"id":10351,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1253,"end_offset":1266},{"id":10340,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":628,"end_offset":645},{"id":10344,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":774,"end_offset":815},{"id":10345,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":906,"end_offset":919},{"id":10346,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":921,"end_offset":955}],"relations":[{"id":4772,"from_id":10328,"to_id":10352,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4773,"from_id":10328,"to_id":10356,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4774,"from_id":10328,"to_id":10360,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4775,"from_id":10364,"to_id":10365,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":4776,"from_id":10328,"to_id":10363,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4755,"from_id":10329,"to_id":10330,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4757,"from_id":10332,"to_id":10333,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":4756,"from_id":10332,"to_id":10331,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4758,"from_id":10328,"to_id":10334,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4765,"from_id":10328,"to_id":10339,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4759,"from_id":10328,"to_id":10335,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4760,"from_id":10328,"to_id":10336,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4761,"from_id":10328,"to_id":10337,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4762,"from_id":10341,"to_id":10342,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":4763,"from_id":10345,"to_id":10343,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4764,"from_id":10328,"to_id":10338,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4766,"from_id":10328,"to_id":10346,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4767,"from_id":10328,"to_id":10347,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4770,"from_id":10351,"to_id":10348,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4768,"from_id":10348,"to_id":10350,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":4769,"from_id":10349,"to_id":10350,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":4771,"from_id":10351,"to_id":10349,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":638,"text":"#Overview - birth defects - LD2Z\nCongenital anomalies (birth defects) can be defined as structural or functional anomalies (e.g. metabolic disorders) that occur during intrauterine life and can be identified prenatally, at birth or later in life. Congenital anomalies are also known as birth defects, congenital disorders or congenital malformations. Congenital anomalies are the major cause of new born deaths within four weeks of birth and can result in long-term disability with a significant impact on individuals, families, societies and health-care systems. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2010, an estimated 270 000 deaths during the first 28 days of life were reported due to congenital anomalies globally. According to March of Dimes (MOD) global report on birth defects 7.9 million births (6% of total births) occur annually worldwide with serious birth defects and 94% of these births occur in the middle and low income countries. According to joint WHO and MOD meeting report, birth defects account for 7% of all neonatal mortality and 3.3 million under five deaths. The prevalence of birth defects in India is 6-7% which translates to around 1.7 million birth defects annually. The common birth defects include congenital heart disease (8-10 per 1000 live births), congenital deafness (5.6-10 per 1000 live births), and neural tube defects (4-11.4 per 1000 live births) (March of Dimes report, 2006). Some birth defects are clinically apparent at birth; others may only be diagnosed later in life. The structural defect such as spina bifida is obvious at birth whereas haemophilia a functional defect (a bleeding disorder) is not usually obvious until infancy or childhood. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has addressed the problem with the implementation of various national health programmes. In 2013, National Child Health Screening and Early Intervention Services covered 30 health conditions of the children aged 0-18 years through various approaches. India Newborn Action Plan (INAP) formulated in September 2014, has integrated the approaches for the prevention and care of newborn with birth defects into primary health care, with an emphasis on maternal and child health. INAP is India’s committed response to the Global Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) by WHO with a vision to eliminate preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.","entities":[{"id":10380,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":33,"end_offset":69},{"id":10381,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":25},{"id":10383,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":351,"end_offset":371},{"id":10384,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":286,"end_offset":299},{"id":10385,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":786,"end_offset":799},{"id":10389,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":129,"end_offset":148},{"id":10390,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1439,"end_offset":1452},{"id":10391,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1222,"end_offset":1235},{"id":10392,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1009,"end_offset":1022},{"id":10394,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1187,"end_offset":1200},{"id":10382,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":247,"end_offset":267},{"id":10386,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":878,"end_offset":891},{"id":10387,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":301,"end_offset":321},{"id":10388,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":325,"end_offset":349},{"id":10393,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1117,"end_offset":1130}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

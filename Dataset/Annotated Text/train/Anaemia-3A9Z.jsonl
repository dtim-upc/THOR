Blood loss can be short term or long term depending upon the conditions. Bleeding in the digestive or urinary tract can cause blood loss. Surgery, trauma, or cancer also can cause blood loss. Heavy blood loss due to menstruation. Lack of Red Blood cell production: It can be due to \"acquired\" or \"Inherited\". \"Acquired\" means that the person is not born with the condition, but may develop it at later stages. \"Inherited\" means that the condition has been passed by the parents. Acquired conditions and factors that can lead to anaemia include: Poor diet, Unusual hormonal levels, Chronic diseases. High rates of RBCs destruction: Factors that can cause destruction of red blood cells. One condition can be an enlarged or diseased spleen.This is an acquired condition.","entities":[{"id":5390,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":17},{"id":5391,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":45,"end_offset":52},{"id":5392,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":58,"end_offset":68},{"id":5395,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":70,"end_offset":97},{"id":5396,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":99,"end_offset":139},{"id":5397,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":195,"end_offset":202},{"id":5400,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":234,"end_offset":241},{"id":5404,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":144,"end_offset":154},{"id":5405,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":156,"end_offset":166},{"id":5406,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":243,"end_offset":253},{"id":5427,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":316,"end_offset":358},{"id":5428,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":381,"end_offset":388},{"id":5429,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":390,"end_offset":396},{"id":5430,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":401,"end_offset":407},{"id":5431,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":369,"end_offset":379},{"id":5432,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":423,"end_offset":433},{"id":5433,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":435,"end_offset":471},{"id":5434,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":473,"end_offset":506},{"id":5435,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":788,"end_offset":797},{"id":5437,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":824,"end_offset":840},{"id":5436,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":799,"end_offset":821},{"id":5438,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":874,"end_offset":927}],"relations":[{"id":2151,"from_id":5391,"to_id":5392,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2152,"from_id":5391,"to_id":5395,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2153,"from_id":5391,"to_id":5396,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2157,"from_id":5397,"to_id":5405,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2175,"from_id":5390,"to_id":5427,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2176,"from_id":5390,"to_id":5431,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2177,"from_id":5390,"to_id":5428,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2178,"from_id":5390,"to_id":5429,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2179,"from_id":5390,"to_id":5430,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2180,"from_id":5390,"to_id":5432,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2181,"from_id":5390,"to_id":5433,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2182,"from_id":5390,"to_id":5434,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2183,"from_id":5390,"to_id":5435,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2184,"from_id":5390,"to_id":5436,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2185,"from_id":5391,"to_id":5437,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2186,"from_id":5390,"to_id":5438,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

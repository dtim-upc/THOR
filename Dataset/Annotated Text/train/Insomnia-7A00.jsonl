{"id":1188,"text":"#Overview - Insomnia - 7A00\nInsomnia or sleeplessness, is a disorder characterized by an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep for a desired duration. Insomnia is generally seen as both a sign and a symptom that can accompany several sleep, medical, and psychiatric disorders characterized by a persistent difficulty falling asleep. Insomnia is typically followed by functional impairment while awake. Insomnia can occur at any age, but it is particularly common in the elderly. Types of insomnia: Insomnia can be classified as acute, or chronic. 1.Acute insomnia: It is the inability to sleep well for a period of less than a month. Insomnia is present when there is difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep or when the sleep that is obtained is non-refreshing or of poor quality. These types of insomnia occurs despite there is adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep, and they must result in problems with daytime function. Acute insomnia is also known as short term insomnia or stress related insomnia. 2.Chronic insomnia: It lasts for more than a month. It can be caused by another disorder, or it can be a primary disorder. People with high levels of stress hormones or shifts in the levels of cytokines are more likely to have chronic insomnia. Its effects can vary according to its causes. They might include muscular fatigue, hallucinations, and\/or mental fatigue. Those people that live with this disorder have hallucinations and tend to see things as if they are happening in slow motion. Chronic insomnia can cause double vision.","entities":[{"id":17654,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":60,"end_offset":68},{"id":17656,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":338,"end_offset":346},{"id":17657,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":372,"end_offset":405},{"id":17658,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":407,"end_offset":415},{"id":17661,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":503,"end_offset":511},{"id":17662,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":554,"end_offset":568},{"id":17665,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":804,"end_offset":812},{"id":17668,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":975,"end_offset":994},{"id":17669,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":998,"end_offset":1021},{"id":17671,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1103,"end_offset":1111},{"id":17673,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1128,"end_offset":1144},{"id":17674,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1158,"end_offset":1188},{"id":17675,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1192,"end_offset":1225},{"id":17677,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1333,"end_offset":1349},{"id":17678,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1351,"end_offset":1365},{"id":17679,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1374,"end_offset":1388},{"id":17680,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1437,"end_offset":1451},{"id":17682,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1543,"end_offset":1556},{"id":17655,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":156,"end_offset":164},{"id":17659,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":475,"end_offset":482},{"id":17660,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":493,"end_offset":501},{"id":17663,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":639,"end_offset":647},{"id":17664,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":673,"end_offset":787},{"id":17666,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":837,"end_offset":885},{"id":17667,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":943,"end_offset":957},{"id":17670,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1025,"end_offset":1041},{"id":17672,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1075,"end_offset":1077},{"id":17676,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1258,"end_offset":1266},{"id":17681,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1516,"end_offset":1533},{"id":17091,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":28,"end_offset":36},{"id":17092,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":40,"end_offset":53},{"id":17090,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":20}],"relations":[{"id":8578,"from_id":17656,"to_id":17657,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8579,"from_id":17658,"to_id":17659,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":8581,"from_id":17665,"to_id":17666,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8582,"from_id":17672,"to_id":17671,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8584,"from_id":17676,"to_id":17674,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":8586,"from_id":17681,"to_id":17682,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":8580,"from_id":17663,"to_id":17664,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8583,"from_id":17672,"to_id":17673,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8585,"from_id":17676,"to_id":17675,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"}],"Comments":[]}

CBT is usually recommended if someone had sleep problems for more than four weeks. It includes: Stimulus-control therapy- which aims to help associate the bedroom with sleep and establish a consistent sleep\/wake pattern. Sleep restriction therapy - The amount of time spent in bed to the actual amount of time spent asleep, creating mild sleep deprivation; sleep time is then increased as your sleeping improves. Relaxation training – This aims to reduce tension or minimize intrusive thoughts that may be interfering with sleep. Paradoxical intention –Try to stay awake and avoid any intention of falling asleep, it's only used if someone have trouble getting to sleep, but not maintaining sleep. Biofeedback – Sensors connected to a machine are placed on the body to measure responses, such as muscle tension and heart rate; the machine produces pictures or sounds to help control breathing and body responses.

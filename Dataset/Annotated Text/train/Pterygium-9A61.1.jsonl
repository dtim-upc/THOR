{"id":1731,"text":"#Diagnosis - Pterygium - 9A61.1\nDiagnosis of pterygium is based on typical clinical appearance. A pterygium causes fibro-vascular change on the surface of conjunctiva and cornea. It is more common for the pterygium to be present on the nasal conjunctiva and then to extend onto the surface of cornea, although it can present temporally, as well as in other locations. Clinically, pterygium can present in different fashion: Slow growing Pterygium: Pterygium present as flat, slow growing lesion with minimal proliferation and a relatively atrophic appearance. Pterygium on surgical excision has a relatively lower incidence of recurrence. Rapidly growing pterygium: Pterygium present as significantly elevated fibro-vascular, rapidly growing lesion. It is progressive and fleshy with prominent vessels. Pterygium has a more aggressive clinical course and a higher incidence of recurrence following surgical excision. Imaging studies: Corneal topography: Corneal topography may be useful in assessing the degree of irregular astigmatism being produced by advanced pterygium. External photography: External surface photography may be done for pterygium to follow its progression over the time.","entities":[{"id":23094,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":424,"end_offset":446},{"id":23096,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":448,"end_offset":457},{"id":23098,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":528,"end_offset":558},{"id":23100,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":639,"end_offset":664},{"id":23102,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":666,"end_offset":675},{"id":23103,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":701,"end_offset":724},{"id":23104,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":727,"end_offset":748},{"id":23105,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":803,"end_offset":812},{"id":23106,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":917,"end_offset":932},{"id":23107,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":934,"end_offset":952},{"id":23097,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":475,"end_offset":494},{"id":23099,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":560,"end_offset":569},{"id":23108,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":954,"end_offset":972},{"id":23109,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1054,"end_offset":1072},{"id":23077,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":45,"end_offset":54},{"id":23078,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":98,"end_offset":107},{"id":23085,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":236,"end_offset":253},{"id":23110,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1074,"end_offset":1094},{"id":23112,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1141,"end_offset":1150},{"id":23076,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":22},{"id":23111,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1096,"end_offset":1124},{"id":23080,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":116,"end_offset":177},{"id":23083,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":205,"end_offset":214},{"id":23086,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":282,"end_offset":299}],"relations":[{"id":11668,"from_id":23078,"to_id":23080,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11681,"from_id":23102,"to_id":23104,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11682,"from_id":23109,"to_id":23108,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":11684,"from_id":23112,"to_id":23111,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":11671,"from_id":23083,"to_id":23085,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":11672,"from_id":23083,"to_id":23086,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":11680,"from_id":23102,"to_id":23103,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11683,"from_id":23109,"to_id":23106,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1734,"text":"#Treatment - Pterygium - 9A61.1\nManagement should be carried out under medical supervision. Management of pterygium involves medical and surgical therapy. Corneal extension of pterygium should be measured and followed periodically every one to two years to determine the rate of growth toward the visual axis. Patient should be observed for symptoms of significant redness, discomfort or changes in visual function. Medical therapy: Medical therapy includes: Use of UV light blocking glasses: Patients who are at risk of developing pterygium because of a positive family history or because of extended period of exposure to UV light should use UV blocking glasses. Patient should avoid direct sunlight, wear goggles or may use cap to reduce ocular exposure. Use of tear substitutes: Use of tear substitutes may be considered to minimise effect of environmental micro-trauma in those who are exposed to it. Lubricating drops and ointments may be used to alleviate symptoms of inflamed pterygium. Vasoconstrictor drugs: Inflammation of pterygium may cause irritation, foreign body sensation and tearing and these symptoms may be relieved by use of vasoconstrictor eye drops. Surgical therapy: Pterygium can be removed for cosmetic reasons, as well as for any functional abnormality of vision or any symptoms of ocular discomfort. Indications for surgical treatment of pterygium are: Encroachment upon pupillary area and blocking visual axis, thereby causing diminution of vision. Distortion of vision due to high astigmatism being induced by pterygium extending onto cornea. Recurrent inflammation. Evidence of progression like absence of Stockerâ€™s line. Restriction of ocular movement with diplopia. Cosmetic removal.

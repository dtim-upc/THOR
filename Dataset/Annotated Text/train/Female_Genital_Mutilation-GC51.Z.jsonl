{"id":983,"text":"#Overview - Female Genital Mutilation - GC51.Z\nFemale genital mutilation (FGM) is a global problem which affects girls and women worldwide. Female genital mutilation (FGM) includes procedures that intentionally alter or cause injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. FGM comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. Human Rights violated by the practice of FGM: Right to the highest attainable standard of health. Right to life and physical integrity, including freedom from violence. Right to freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Right to equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex. Rights of the child. The practice is mostly carried out by traditional circumcisers, who often play other central roles in communities, such as attending childbirths. In many settings, health care providers perform FGM due to the erroneous belief that the procedure is safer when medicalized. WHO strongly urges health professionals not to perform such procedures. In 2008, the World Health Assembly passed resolution (WHA61.16) on the elimination of FGM, emphasizing the need for concerted action in all sectors - health, education, finance, justice and women's affairs. In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on the elimination of female genital mutilation3. In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) includes a target under Goal 5 to eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and FGM\/C, by the year 2030.","entities":[{"id":14377,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":47,"end_offset":78},{"id":14379,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":240,"end_offset":261},{"id":14380,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":220,"end_offset":232},{"id":14376,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":37},{"id":14378,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":140,"end_offset":171},{"id":14381,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":287,"end_offset":290},{"id":14383,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":411,"end_offset":432},{"id":14382,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":361,"end_offset":386},{"id":14384,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":397,"end_offset":403},{"id":14385,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":499,"end_offset":502}],"relations":[{"id":6893,"from_id":14381,"to_id":14382,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":6892,"from_id":14378,"to_id":14380,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":6891,"from_id":14378,"to_id":14379,"type":"affects_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":985,"text":"#Prevention - Female Genital Mutilation - GC51.Z\nFGM has no health benefits, and it harms girls and women in many ways. It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women. Despite this, a number of myths and misconceptions about FGM persist, which support the perpetuation of this harmful practice. In 1997, WHO issued a joint statement against the practice of FGM together with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). Since 1997, great efforts have been made to counteract FGM, through research, work within communities, and changes in public policy. In 2007, UNFPA and UNICEF initiated the Joint Programme on Female Genital Mutilation\/Cutting to accelerate the abandonment of the practice. In 2008, the World Health Assembly passed resolution WHA61.16 on the elimination of FGM, emphasizing the need for concerted action in all sectors - health, education, finance, justice and women's affairs. In 2008, WHO together with 9 other United Nations partners, issued a statement on the elimination of FGM to support increased advocacy for its abandonment, called: “Eliminating female genital mutilation: an interagency statement”. This statement provided evidence collected over the previous decade about the practice of FGM. In 2010, WHO published a \"Global strategy to stop health care providers from performing female genital mutilation\" in collaboration with other key UN agencies and international organizations. In December 2012, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution on the elimination of female genital mutilation. The Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 calls for an end to FGM by 2030 under goal 5 on gender equality, target 5.3 eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation. In May 2016, WHO in collaboration with the UNFPA-UNICEF joint programme on FGM launched the first evidence-based guidelines on the management of health complications from FGM. To promote the elimination of FGM, coordinated and systematic efforts are needed, and they must engage whole communities and focus on human rights and gender equality. International Day of Zero Tolerance to Female Genital Mutilation is observed on February 6 to raise awareness and educate people about the dangers of female genital mutilation (FGM) and to take concrete actions against it.","entities":[{"id":14396,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":49,"end_offset":52},{"id":14398,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":178,"end_offset":223},{"id":14399,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":123,"end_offset":172},{"id":14400,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":296,"end_offset":299},{"id":14395,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":14,"end_offset":39},{"id":14397,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":120,"end_offset":122},{"id":14401,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":428,"end_offset":431}],"relations":[{"id":6898,"from_id":14397,"to_id":14399,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":6899,"from_id":14397,"to_id":14398,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"}],"Comments":[]}

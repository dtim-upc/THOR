{"id":815,"text":"#Overview - Duane Retraction Syndrome - 9C82.2\nDuane retraction syndrome is characterised by retraction of globe (eyeball) on attempted adduction (inward movement) caused due to co-contraction of both medial and lateral rectus muscle of the involved eye. Duane retraction syndrome is a non-progressive congenital disorder of eye movement, which may occur either in isolation or in the form of syndrome associated with other congenital defects, most common is perceptive deafness with associated speech disorder. It may be associated with strabismus in primary gaze. Horizontal eye movement is governed by lateral rectus muscle, which pulls the eye outward and by medial rectus muscle, which pulls the eye inward. When lateral rectus muscle of an eye contracts and pull the eyeball outward, the medial rectus of the same eye relaxes. The contra-lateral medial rectus muscle contracts and the lateral rectus muscle relaxes to a similar extent for smooth movement of eyeballs.","entities":[{"id":11962,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":37},{"id":11963,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":47,"end_offset":72},{"id":11965,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":107,"end_offset":122},{"id":11966,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":255,"end_offset":280},{"id":11967,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":286,"end_offset":321},{"id":11969,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":495,"end_offset":510},{"id":11971,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":605,"end_offset":626},{"id":11972,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":644,"end_offset":647},{"id":11973,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":663,"end_offset":683},{"id":11974,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":701,"end_offset":704},{"id":11975,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":718,"end_offset":739},{"id":11977,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":773,"end_offset":780},{"id":11982,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":964,"end_offset":972},{"id":11964,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":178,"end_offset":253},{"id":11968,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":325,"end_offset":328},{"id":11970,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":577,"end_offset":580},{"id":11976,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":746,"end_offset":749},{"id":11978,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":790,"end_offset":807},{"id":11979,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":820,"end_offset":823},{"id":11980,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":837,"end_offset":872},{"id":11981,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":891,"end_offset":912}],"relations":[{"id":5632,"from_id":11963,"to_id":11964,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5633,"from_id":11966,"to_id":11967,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":5631,"from_id":11963,"to_id":11965,"type":"affects_R"}],"Comments":[]}

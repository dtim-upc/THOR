{"id":1300,"text":"#Causes - Keratoconus - 9A78.50\nStudies suggest various contributory factors such as: Enzyme abnormalities in corneal epithelium: Enzyme abnormalities such as increased expression of lysosomal enzymes (catalase and cathepsin) and decreased levels of inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes (tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinases), may play a role in corneal stromal degradation. Differentially expressed corneal epithelium: Differentially expressed corneal epithelium between keratoconus and myopes (as controls) in both genetic expression and protein expression. Molecular defect: Molecular defect producing unusual absence of water channel protein aquaporin 5 in keratoconus as compared to normal corneal epithelium. Gelatinolytic activity: Gelatinolytic activity in stroma has been described, which may be due to decreased function of enzyme inhibitors. Abnormalities in corneal collagen and its cross-linking: Abnormalities in corneal collagen and its cross-linking may be the cause of keratoconus. Eye rubbing: Cytokine has been suggested as a mediator of eye rubbing and stromal degradation. Keratoconus in patients with atopic dermatitis, Down syndrome, and Leber congenital amaurosis, a congenital photoreceptor degeneration, could be related to forceful eye rubbing or the oculodigital reflex. The latter is a behavioural pattern seen in visually and mentally handicapped children who repeatedly strike their eyes with hands.

{"id":1302,"text":"#Diagnosis - Keratoconus - 9A78.50\nRefraction, keratometry, corneal topography and slit- lamp (bio-microscopy) examination helps in reaching to the diagnosis of keratoconus. Refraction: Patients with keratoconus often report blurring\/impairment of vision due to progressive myopia and irregular astigmatism. There may be multiple unsatisfactory attempts in obtaining optimum correction with glasses. Spectacles and soft contact lenses may initially give satisfactory vision, but vision tends to decline over time and requires rigid gas-permeable contact lenses for correction. Keratometry: Images of keratometry mires commonly will be steep, highly astigmatic, irregular, and often appear egg-shaped rather than circular or oval in keratoconus. A value of 47.2 Diopters (D) or greater is suggestive of keratoconus. These signs may be absent in some patients of keratoconus. Corneal topography\/Computerised videokeratography: is helpful in reaching a diagnosis, especially when the typical bio-microscopy signs of Vogt striae and Fleischer ring are absent. Several quantitative indices are available using corneal topography information to screen for keratoconus. Ultrasonic pachymetry: Ultrasonic pachymetry may be useful to confirm corneal thinning in patients with suspected keratoconus on slit- lamp examination or videokeratography. Orbscan corneal topography system and Oculus Pentacam which provides both topography and pachymetry maps are particularly useful in making a diagnosis.","entities":[{"id":18480,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":24},{"id":18482,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":47,"end_offset":58},{"id":18484,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":83,"end_offset":122},{"id":18487,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":200,"end_offset":211},{"id":18490,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":285,"end_offset":306},{"id":18492,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":600,"end_offset":617},{"id":18493,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":861,"end_offset":872},{"id":18494,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":802,"end_offset":813},{"id":18495,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":874,"end_offset":892},{"id":18497,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1150,"end_offset":1161},{"id":18499,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1186,"end_offset":1207},{"id":18500,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1277,"end_offset":1288},{"id":18501,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1163,"end_offset":1184},{"id":18502,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1292,"end_offset":1314},{"id":18504,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1337,"end_offset":1363},{"id":18481,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":35,"end_offset":45},{"id":18483,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":60,"end_offset":78},{"id":18485,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":161,"end_offset":172},{"id":18486,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":174,"end_offset":184},{"id":18488,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":225,"end_offset":254},{"id":18489,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":274,"end_offset":280},{"id":18491,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":577,"end_offset":588},{"id":18496,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":893,"end_offset":923},{"id":18503,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1318,"end_offset":1335},{"id":18505,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1375,"end_offset":1390}],"relations":[{"id":9017,"from_id":18485,"to_id":18481,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":9019,"from_id":18485,"to_id":18483,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":9021,"from_id":18487,"to_id":18488,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":9023,"from_id":18487,"to_id":18489,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":9028,"from_id":18500,"to_id":18502,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":9031,"from_id":18480,"to_id":18505,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":9018,"from_id":18485,"to_id":18482,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":9020,"from_id":18485,"to_id":18484,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":9024,"from_id":18487,"to_id":18490,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":9025,"from_id":18491,"to_id":18492,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":9026,"from_id":18480,"to_id":18496,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":9027,"from_id":18500,"to_id":18499,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":9029,"from_id":18500,"to_id":18503,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":9030,"from_id":18480,"to_id":18504,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

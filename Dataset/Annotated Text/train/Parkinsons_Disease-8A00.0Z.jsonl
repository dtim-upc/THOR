{"id":1494,"text":"#Causes - Parkinsons Disease - 8A00.0Z\nParkinson's disease\/ Parkinsonian syndrome is caused by a loss of nerve cells in the part of the brain called the substantia nigra. Nerve cells in this part of the brain are responsible for producing a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine acts as a messenger in the nervous system, and helps control and co-ordinate body movements. If these nerve cells become damaged or die, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced. This means that the part of the brain controlling movement cannot work so well, which causes movements to become slow and abnormal. The loss of nerve cells is a slow process.","entities":[{"id":20489,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":28},{"id":20491,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":60,"end_offset":81},{"id":20493,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":171,"end_offset":182},{"id":20494,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":199,"end_offset":208},{"id":20490,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":39,"end_offset":58},{"id":20492,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":97,"end_offset":169},{"id":20495,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":299,"end_offset":317},{"id":20496,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":605,"end_offset":616}],"relations":[{"id":10188,"from_id":20490,"to_id":20492,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1496,"text":"#Prevention - Parkinsons Disease - 8A00.0Z\nThere is no definitive preventive strategy for Parkinson’s disease. Healthy life style and early diagnosis are helpful in disability limitation and care planning. Caffeine consumption appears to be protective against Parkinson's disease, though the exact mechanism is not clearly understood. Although tobacco smoking decreases life expectancy and quality of life, it may reduce the risk of PD. The protective effect is more related to duration than quantity.  This may be the effect of nicotine as a dopamine stimulant.","entities":[{"id":20507,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":206,"end_offset":226},{"id":20508,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":260,"end_offset":279},{"id":20509,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":344,"end_offset":359},{"id":20510,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":433,"end_offset":435},{"id":20503,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":90,"end_offset":109},{"id":20504,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":111,"end_offset":129},{"id":20505,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":134,"end_offset":149},{"id":20506,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":165,"end_offset":175},{"id":20502,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":14,"end_offset":32}],"relations":[{"id":10194,"from_id":20502,"to_id":20505,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":10193,"from_id":20502,"to_id":20504,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":10192,"from_id":20508,"to_id":20507,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":10191,"from_id":20510,"to_id":20509,"type":"has_precaution_R"}],"Comments":[]}

In initial stage individual with PD develops some disability for which he needs pharmacological treatment. In the later stage the patient develops motor complications related to levodopa usage. In the second stage the aim is to reduce symptoms while controlling fluctuations of the response to medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed. Surgery: When medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery and deep brain stimulation can be of use.

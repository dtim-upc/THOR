{"id":514,"text":"#Diagnosis - Bells Palsy - 8B88.0\nThere is no specific test to diagnose Bellâ€™s palsy. Symptoms associated with the bell's palsy help physician to determine the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): It is used to determine the cause of the pressure on facial nerve. MRI scans use radio waves and a strong magnetic field to produce a detailed image of the inside of body. Computerized tomography (CT) scan: It is also be used to detect other causes of symptoms, such as an infection or tumor. A facial CT scan may also be carried out to rule out facial fractures. Electromyography (EMG): It is a very thin needle electrode that is inserted through the skin into the muscle. A machine called an oscilloscope is then used to measure the electrical activity of the muscles and nerves. The information provided by an EMG can be used to assess the extent of any nerve damage.","entities":[{"id":8871,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":24},{"id":8872,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":72,"end_offset":84},{"id":8874,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":169,"end_offset":201},{"id":8875,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":256,"end_offset":268},{"id":8876,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":270,"end_offset":279},{"id":8877,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":359,"end_offset":373},{"id":8879,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":476,"end_offset":494},{"id":8880,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":496,"end_offset":507},{"id":8873,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":115,"end_offset":127},{"id":8878,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":375,"end_offset":408},{"id":8881,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":549,"end_offset":565},{"id":8882,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":567,"end_offset":589},{"id":8883,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":655,"end_offset":659},{"id":8884,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":669,"end_offset":675},{"id":8886,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":777,"end_offset":783},{"id":8885,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":761,"end_offset":772},{"id":8887,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":816,"end_offset":819},{"id":8888,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":860,"end_offset":872}],"relations":[{"id":3968,"from_id":8871,"to_id":8882,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3969,"from_id":8871,"to_id":8887,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3961,"from_id":8874,"to_id":8875,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":3963,"from_id":8871,"to_id":8876,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3962,"from_id":8871,"to_id":8874,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3964,"from_id":8871,"to_id":8878,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3965,"from_id":8871,"to_id":8880,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3966,"from_id":8882,"to_id":8883,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":3967,"from_id":8882,"to_id":8884,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":518,"text":"#Treatment - Bells Palsy - 8B88.0\nPain relievers: Paracetamol and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen etc. are effective pain killers. Hot and cold treatment: Hot bath or a hot water bottle placed on the affected area helps ease the pain. Cold treatment such as an ice pack or a bag of frozen vegetables, placed on the painful area is also effective. Relaxing: Trying to relax is a crucial part of easing the pain because muscle tension caused by worrying about condition can make things worse. Medication: Corticosteroids like Prednisolone helps in reducing inflammation (swelling), which should also help to speed up your recovery.

{"id":1223,"text":"#Overview - Myopia - 9D00.0\nMyopia or short-sightedness is that type of refractive error where parallel rays of light coming from infinity are focused in front of the light sensitive layer of retina with eyes in position of rest. The term ‘myopia’ was introduced due to the habit of myopic people of half closing the eyelids while looking at distant objects, so that they may have the advantages of a stenopaeic slit (a black disc punctured with a fine slit or hole). Refractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye.","entities":[{"id":17517,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":18},{"id":17519,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":38,"end_offset":55},{"id":17520,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":72,"end_offset":88},{"id":17523,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":240,"end_offset":246},{"id":17527,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":606,"end_offset":613},{"id":17528,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":717,"end_offset":720},{"id":17518,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":28,"end_offset":34},{"id":17521,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":173,"end_offset":198},{"id":17522,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":204,"end_offset":208},{"id":17524,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":492,"end_offset":495},{"id":17525,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":555,"end_offset":561},{"id":17526,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":576,"end_offset":580}],"relations":[{"id":8495,"from_id":17518,"to_id":17520,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Proper posture and adequate illumination is required during close work. Optical therapy: Appropriate glasses\/contact lenses may be used to provide clear retinal image. Minimum correcting power providing maximum vision is given. Spectacle correction: Spectacle correction may be given, but it produces minification of object size and distortion of peripheral image in cases with high myopia.

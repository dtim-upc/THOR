{"id":274,"text":"#Causes - Autism - 6A02.Z\nThe exact reason for the causes of ASD is not known, but it’s likely to be associated to genetics and environment factors.  Number of genes have been identified that are associated with this disorder. Studies of patients with ASD have also found irregularities in several regions of the brain. Other studies suggest that people with ASD have abnormal levels of serotonin or other neurotransmitters in the brain. All these abnormalities suggest that ASD could result from the disturbance of normal brain development early in foetal development caused by defects in genes that control brain growth and that regulate how brain cells communicate with each other, possibly due to the influence of environmental factors on gene function.

People with autistic disorder typically have significant language interruption, social and communication challenges, and unusual behaviours and interests. Asperger Syndrome: People with Asperger syndrome, have mild symptoms of autistic disorder. They might have social challenges and unusual behaviours and interests.

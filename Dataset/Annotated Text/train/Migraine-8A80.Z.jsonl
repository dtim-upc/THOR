There are five distinct stages of migraine, though not everyone goes through all the stages: 'Prodromal' (pre-headache) stage: Some people experience changes in mood, energy levels, behaviour and appetite, and sometimes aches and pains several hours or days before an attack. Aura: Symptoms of aura include flashes of light or blind spots, difficulty focusing, and seeing things as if they are looking through a broken mirror. Headache stage: This is usually a pulsating or throbbing pain on one side of the head. Resolution stage: Most attacks gradually fade away. Some people find the headache stops suddenly after they have been sick. Postdromal' or recovery phase: There may be a stage of exhaustion and weakness afterwards.

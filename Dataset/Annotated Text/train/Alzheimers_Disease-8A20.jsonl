{"id":278,"text":"#Diagnosis - Alzheimer Disease - 8A20\nEarly, accurate diagnosis is crucial for several reasons. It can tell people whether their symptoms are due to Alzheimer’s disease or another cause, such as stroke, tumour, Parkinson’s disease, sleep disturbances, side effects of medications, or other conditions that may be treatable and possibly reversible. Although definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's can be made only after death, yet the doctors can usually diagnose the disease with the help of: Past medical history and current health status. Changes in the behavior and personality of the patient. Conducting cognitive tests involving memory, problem solving, language, etc. Standard medical tests, such as blood and urine tests, in order to rule out other causes. Brain scans including CT\/MRI scans.","entities":[{"id":5319,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":30},{"id":5320,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":45,"end_offset":63},{"id":5322,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":149,"end_offset":168},{"id":5324,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":195,"end_offset":201},{"id":5351,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":594,"end_offset":664},{"id":5354,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":783,"end_offset":795},{"id":5323,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":381,"end_offset":392},{"id":5325,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":203,"end_offset":209},{"id":5326,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":211,"end_offset":230},{"id":5327,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":232,"end_offset":250},{"id":5328,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":252,"end_offset":279},{"id":5352,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":671,"end_offset":693},{"id":5353,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":703,"end_offset":725}],"relations":[{"id":2126,"from_id":5320,"to_id":5354,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2125,"from_id":5319,"to_id":5353,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2124,"from_id":5319,"to_id":5352,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2123,"from_id":5319,"to_id":5351,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2118,"from_id":5322,"to_id":5328,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2117,"from_id":5322,"to_id":5327,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2116,"from_id":5322,"to_id":5326,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2115,"from_id":5322,"to_id":5325,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2114,"from_id":5322,"to_id":5324,"type":"has_symptom_R"}],"Comments":[]}

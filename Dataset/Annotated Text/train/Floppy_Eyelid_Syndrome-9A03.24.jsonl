{"id":1363,"text":"#Overview - Floppy Eyelid Syndrome - 9A03.24\nFloppy eyelid syndrome (FES) is frequently an unrecognised cause of chronic, non-infectious unilateral or bilateral papillary conjunctivitis. It is characterised by loose floppy eyelids associated with punctate epithelial keratopathy (PEK), ptosis of lateral eyelashes and typical conjunctival changes. It affects patients of both sexes ranging in age from two to eighty years, but it affects more commonly middle-aged obese males. The floppiness of the eyelids is due to laxity of the tarsus. Decrease in tarsal elastin contributes to the laxity of eyelids.","entities":[{"id":19129,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":210,"end_offset":284},{"id":19130,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":286,"end_offset":346},{"id":19131,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":348,"end_offset":351},{"id":19132,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":477,"end_offset":506},{"id":19134,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":595,"end_offset":602},{"id":19125,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":34},{"id":19126,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":45,"end_offset":73},{"id":19127,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":113,"end_offset":185},{"id":19128,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":187,"end_offset":190},{"id":19133,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":517,"end_offset":537}],"relations":[{"id":9372,"from_id":19126,"to_id":19127,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":9373,"from_id":19128,"to_id":19129,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":9374,"from_id":19128,"to_id":19130,"type":"has_symptom_R"}],"Comments":[]}

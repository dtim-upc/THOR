{"id":634,"text":"#Overview - Conjunctival Concretions - 9A61.6\nConjunctival concretions (Conjunctival lithiasis) are small vascular, granular, yellowish-white deposits being produced due to conjunctival degeneration and are found in the sub-epithelium of palpebral conjunctiva and fornix (junction between palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva) in the elderly group or in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Deposits were found in patients as young as 20 years old, with the range of occurrence from 30-80 years old. Concretions appear as multiple tiny inclusion cysts containing yellowish-white deposits of inspissated mucous and degenerated epithelial debris including keratin. They are frequently discrete, but confluent concretions are not uncommon. In one study, no significant difference was found between the lacalisation on the upper and lower eyelids, right or left eye, and most of the concretions were superficial and hard, and mainly single. Associated dysfunction of meibomian glands was also noticed in some patients.","entities":[{"id":10306,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":36},{"id":10307,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":46,"end_offset":95},{"id":10310,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":264,"end_offset":322},{"id":10311,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":364,"end_offset":395},{"id":10314,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":713,"end_offset":724},{"id":10315,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":841,"end_offset":848},{"id":10308,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":173,"end_offset":198},{"id":10309,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":220,"end_offset":259},{"id":10312,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":506,"end_offset":517},{"id":10313,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":552,"end_offset":557},{"id":10316,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":864,"end_offset":867},{"id":10317,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":885,"end_offset":896},{"id":10318,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":969,"end_offset":985}],"relations":[{"id":4745,"from_id":10307,"to_id":10308,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4746,"from_id":10307,"to_id":10311,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":4747,"from_id":10312,"to_id":10313,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

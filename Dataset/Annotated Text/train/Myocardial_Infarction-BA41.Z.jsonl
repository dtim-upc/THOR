{"id":1691,"text":"#Diagnosis - Myocardial Infarction - BA41.Z\nAccording to the WHO criteria as revised in 2000, a cardiac troponin rise accompanied by either typical symptoms, pathological Q waves, ST elevation or depression or coronary intervention are diagnostic of MI. Physical examination: The appearance of patients may vary according to the symptoms. A cold and pale skin is common and points to vasoconstriction. Some patients have low-grade fever (38–39 °C). Blood pressure may be elevated or decreased, and the pulse can become irregular. Electrocardiogram (ECG): 12-lead electrocardiogram showing ST-segment elevation in I and V1-V5 with reciprocal changes (blue) in the inferior leads, indicative of an anterior wall myocardial infarction. Cardiac markers: Cardiac markers or cardiac enzymes are proteins that leak out of injured myocardial cells through their damaged cell membranes into the bloodstream. Angiography: To restore blood flow, coronary angiography can be performed. Exercise stress test: This helps to determine how well heart is working when it has to pump more blood. Doppler test: A Doppler test uses reflected sound waves to see how blood flows through a blood vessel.","entities":[{"id":22715,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":34},{"id":22720,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":250,"end_offset":252},{"id":22721,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":254,"end_offset":274},{"id":22722,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":339,"end_offset":359},{"id":22725,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":421,"end_offset":447},{"id":22726,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":449,"end_offset":528},{"id":22730,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":710,"end_offset":731},{"id":22733,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":733,"end_offset":748},{"id":22739,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":899,"end_offset":910},{"id":22744,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1078,"end_offset":1090},{"id":22749,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1167,"end_offset":1179},{"id":22728,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":530,"end_offset":553},{"id":22734,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":751,"end_offset":784},{"id":22737,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":823,"end_offset":839},{"id":22740,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":935,"end_offset":955},{"id":22742,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":974,"end_offset":994}],"relations":[{"id":11466,"from_id":22730,"to_id":22728,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":11468,"from_id":22715,"to_id":22733,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":11462,"from_id":22715,"to_id":22721,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":11470,"from_id":22715,"to_id":22739,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":11471,"from_id":22715,"to_id":22742,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":11472,"from_id":22715,"to_id":22744,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Anti platelets agents: Drugs like aspirin has been shown to markedly reduce mortality and thus should be taken as soon as possible in those without an allergy to it. Coronary angioplasty: In coronary angioplasty, a tiny tube known as a catheter, with a sausage-shaped balloon at the end, is put into a large artery of groin or arm. The catheter is passed through blood vessels and up to heart, over a fine guide wire, using X-rays to guide it, before being moved into the narrowed section of coronary artery. Once in position, the balloon is inflated inside the narrowed part of the artery to open it wide. Thrombolysis: Thrombolysis involves giving injections which contain thrombolytics. Thrombolytics target and destroy a substance called fibrin. Fibrin is a tough protein that makes up blood clots by acting like a sort of fibre mesh that hardens around the blood. Thrombolytic medications used in the treatment of heart attacks include reteplase, alteplase and streptokinase.","entities":[{"id":22913,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":132,"end_offset":150},{"id":22946,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":899,"end_offset":910},{"id":22947,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":978,"end_offset":1002},{"id":22950,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1050,"end_offset":1059},{"id":22953,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1061,"end_offset":1071},{"id":22907,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":44,"end_offset":62},{"id":22910,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":109,"end_offset":130},{"id":22943,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":759,"end_offset":797},{"id":22948,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1028,"end_offset":1041},{"id":22954,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1075,"end_offset":1088},{"id":22915,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":275,"end_offset":295},{"id":22854,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":34},{"id":22928,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":533,"end_offset":539},{"id":22935,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":716,"end_offset":728},{"id":22930,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":601,"end_offset":616},{"id":22931,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":472,"end_offset":485},{"id":22932,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":490,"end_offset":501}],"relations":[{"id":11594,"from_id":22910,"to_id":22854,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11596,"from_id":22915,"to_id":22854,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11599,"from_id":22943,"to_id":22854,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11600,"from_id":22947,"to_id":22854,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11603,"from_id":22950,"to_id":22948,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11604,"from_id":22953,"to_id":22948,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11605,"from_id":22954,"to_id":22948,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11593,"from_id":22907,"to_id":22854,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11595,"from_id":22913,"to_id":22854,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11597,"from_id":22935,"to_id":22854,"type":"prescribed_for_R"}],"Comments":[]}

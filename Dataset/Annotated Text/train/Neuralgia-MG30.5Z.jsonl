It can be diagnosed with the help of tests like: Laser evoked potentials: Laser evoked potentials (LEPs) are used to measure cortical responses to selectively stimulate thermonociceptors in the skin. Punch skin biopsyz: Recently, skin biopsy has also been used to investigate mechanoreceptors and their myelinated afferents. Though available in only a few research centers, skin punch biopsy is an easy procedure and is minimally invasive.","entities":[{"id":18337,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":22},{"id":18340,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":132,"end_offset":155},{"id":18341,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":277,"end_offset":281},{"id":18338,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":46,"end_offset":55},{"id":18339,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":83,"end_offset":85},{"id":18342,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":283,"end_offset":301},{"id":18343,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":457,"end_offset":474}],"relations":[{"id":8945,"from_id":18337,"to_id":18343,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":8944,"from_id":18337,"to_id":18342,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":8943,"from_id":18337,"to_id":18340,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1291,"text":"#Overview - Neuralgia - MG30.5Z\nNeuralgia is pain in one or more nerves caused by a change in neurological structure or function of the nerves rather than by excitation of healthy pain receptors. Trigeminal neuralgia can be divided into different categories depending on the type of pain. These are described below. Trigeminal neuralgia type 1 (TN1) is the classic form of trigeminal neuralgia. Trigeminal neuralgia type 2 (TN2) can be referred to as atypical (not typical) trigeminal neuralgia. Symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia (STN) is when pain results from an underlying cause, such as multiple sclerosis.","entities":[{"id":18356,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":21},{"id":18357,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":32,"end_offset":41},{"id":18358,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":136,"end_offset":142},{"id":18361,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":316,"end_offset":349},{"id":18364,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":451,"end_offset":494},{"id":18359,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":196,"end_offset":216},{"id":18360,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":283,"end_offset":287},{"id":18362,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":373,"end_offset":393},{"id":18363,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":395,"end_offset":428},{"id":18365,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":496,"end_offset":534},{"id":18366,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":599,"end_offset":608}],"relations":[{"id":8957,"from_id":18365,"to_id":18366,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8956,"from_id":18359,"to_id":18360,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

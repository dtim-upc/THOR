To date, there is no evidence that PMD is genetically inherited. Several conditions have been reported in patients with PMD, but none of them show an obvious pathogenic association. Associated conditions: Chronic open angle glaucoma. Retinal lattice degeneration. Scleroderma. Retinitis pigmentosa. Keratoconjunctivitis. Eczema. Hyperthyroidism.

{"id":1927,"text":"#Overview - Pellucid Marginal Degeneration - 9A78.4\nPellucid marginal degeneration (PMD) is a bilateral (may be asymmetric), progressive, inferior crescentic peripheral thinning of the cornea. There is no vascularisation, infiltration or scarring in the area of involved cornea. Band of thinning measures about 1 to 2mm in width and extends from 4 to 8 o’clock position (about 6 to 8mm), leaving a normal band of 1 to 2mm from the limbus. The condition affects both men and women between 20 to 40 years of age. The condition results in high irregular astigmatism and rarely may develop acute hydrops (stromal oedema due to leakage of aqueous humour through breaks in Descemet’s membrane) or even perforation. It differs from keratoconus in that it has no iron ring, its thinning is in inferior part without a cone; and the corneal protrusion is located above (rather than) in the area of thinning. Pellucid marginal degeneration and keratoconus may exist in the same eye and in different eyes of the same patient. This association in the same patient suggests that pellucid marginal degeneration, keratoconus and keratoglobus (generalised thinning and globular protrusion of the cornea) may be varying spectrum of the same pathophysiology rather than separate disease processes. The central cornea is usually of normal thickness, and the epithelium overlying the area of thinning is intact. Rarely, it may involve superior part of cornea.","entities":[{"id":25097,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":42},{"id":25099,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":138,"end_offset":191},{"id":25100,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":271,"end_offset":277},{"id":25101,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":466,"end_offset":509},{"id":25103,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":586,"end_offset":687},{"id":25104,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":696,"end_offset":707},{"id":25105,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":709,"end_offset":711},{"id":25098,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":52,"end_offset":88},{"id":25106,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":725,"end_offset":736},{"id":25107,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":809,"end_offset":813},{"id":25109,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":823,"end_offset":841},{"id":25110,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":898,"end_offset":928},{"id":25112,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":967,"end_offset":970},{"id":25113,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":988,"end_offset":992},{"id":25116,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1113,"end_offset":1125},{"id":25120,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1414,"end_offset":1437},{"id":25108,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":766,"end_offset":769},{"id":25111,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":933,"end_offset":944},{"id":25114,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1065,"end_offset":1095},{"id":25115,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1097,"end_offset":1108},{"id":25117,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1127,"end_offset":1185},{"id":25118,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1291,"end_offset":1297},{"id":25119,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1338,"end_offset":1348}],"relations":[{"id":12838,"from_id":25114,"to_id":25117,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":12839,"from_id":25115,"to_id":25117,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":12840,"from_id":25116,"to_id":25117,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":12834,"from_id":25098,"to_id":25099,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":12835,"from_id":25108,"to_id":25107,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":12836,"from_id":25110,"to_id":25112,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":12837,"from_id":25111,"to_id":25112,"type":"affects_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1931,"text":"#Treatment - Pellucid Marginal Degeneration - 9A78.4\nManagement should be carried out under medical supervision. Medical therapy: Vast majority of patients with PMD are managed by medical therapy. Management of PMD is dependent on the severity of the disease. Mild stage: Spectacle correction: To begin with in the early mild stages of the disease, spectacle correction is prescribed. Patients with high astigmatism may be prescribed with high refractive index sphero-cylindrical glasses. Soft (hydro gel) toric contact lenses: Soft toric (lenses for astigmatism) contact lenses may be useful in the early mild stages of the condition only, usually before the progression of irregular astigmatism. Hybrid (rigid gas permeable and hydro gel combined) contact lenses viz. Saturn II lenses, SoftPerm lenses and SynergEyes lenses have also been used. Moderate stage: Rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses: Rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses may be required for moderate cases of PMD. Large amount of irregular against-the-rule astigmatism results in unstable lens centration and excessive inferior edge stand-off. Therefore, larger-diameter RGP lenses may provide satisfactory lens stability and tolerance with good visual acuity. ‘Bi-toric’ RGP contact lenses have also been used successfully. Specialised back surface design lenses may correct large amounts of corneal astigmatism and may provide good visual acuity. RGP and soft contact lens with ‘sector management control’ allow peripheral lens geometry to be customised to complement the anterior surface of the ectatic cornea. Surgical therapy: Keratoplasty: Keratoplasty is considered for patients with PMD whose vision is inadequate with contact lenses or for patients who are intolerant to lens. Penetrating keratoplasty: In general, patients with PMD are usually poor candidates for penetrating keratoplasty as the corneal thinning occurs close to the limbus. As a result, large eccentric grafts are required and must be positioned very close to the limbus thus increasing the chances of graft rejection, suture-induced complications and corneal neovascularisation. Penetrating keratoplasty also induces large amounts of post-operative astigmatism which may be difficult to correct due to variation in the graft-host thickness. Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK): In deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK), the anterior third to two-thirds of the cornea is replaced with donor tissue. Lamellar crescentic keratoplasty: In lamellar crescentic keratoplasty, crescent-shaped donor lamellar cornea is used. Lamellar crescentic keratoplasty was used earlier to treat PMD. Lamellar thermo- keratoplasty (LTK): Lamellar thermo-keratoplasty (LTK) is an adaptation of lamellar crescentic keratoplasty. This involves thermal shrinkage of the host lamellar bed, prior to the placement and suturing of the crescent-shaped donor lamellar cornea. Lamellar crescentic resection (LCR): Lamellar crescentic resection (LCR) involves excision of the abnormally thinned stroma and then re-approximation of the near-normal thickness edges. The major advantage is that no donor tissue is required. Corneal wedge excision\/resection: Corneal wedge excision\/resection is similar to lamellar crescentic resection, except that it involves full thickness corneal tissue removal followed by re-apposition of the remaining normal thickness cornea using sutures. Epikeratoplasty: Epikeratoplasty is a rare form of surgery used for PMD. This is a type of on-lay lamellar keratoplasty in which a lens made of human corneal tissue is sutured onto the anterior surface of the cornea to change its anterior curvature and refraction. ‘Tuck-in’ lamellar keratoplasty: ‘Tuck-in’ lamellar keratoplasty refers to a central lamellar keratoplasty with intrastromal tucking of the peripheral flange.","entities":[{"id":25140,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":43},{"id":25142,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":161,"end_offset":164},{"id":25143,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":180,"end_offset":195},{"id":25144,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":211,"end_offset":214},{"id":25199,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":3483,"end_offset":3487},{"id":25200,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":3554,"end_offset":3574},{"id":25202,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":3708,"end_offset":3739},{"id":25203,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":3752,"end_offset":3781},{"id":25141,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":113,"end_offset":128},{"id":25201,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":3675,"end_offset":3706},{"id":25145,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":336,"end_offset":347},{"id":25147,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":404,"end_offset":415},{"id":25149,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":528,"end_offset":563},{"id":25150,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":685,"end_offset":696},{"id":25151,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":698,"end_offset":768},{"id":25154,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":808,"end_offset":825},{"id":25159,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1130,"end_offset":1156},{"id":25163,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1424,"end_offset":1482},{"id":25164,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1573,"end_offset":1587},{"id":25165,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":1589,"end_offset":1605},{"id":25166,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":1607,"end_offset":1619},{"id":25168,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1666,"end_offset":1669},{"id":25172,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":1849,"end_offset":1873},{"id":25174,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1918,"end_offset":1924},{"id":25176,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2132,"end_offset":2156},{"id":25177,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2294,"end_offset":2336},{"id":25178,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2341,"end_offset":2383},{"id":25183,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2500,"end_offset":2532},{"id":25185,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":2640,"end_offset":2643},{"id":25186,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2645,"end_offset":2680},{"id":25187,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2682,"end_offset":2716},{"id":25188,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2737,"end_offset":2769},{"id":25190,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2911,"end_offset":2946},{"id":25146,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":272,"end_offset":292},{"id":25148,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":489,"end_offset":526},{"id":25152,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":770,"end_offset":786},{"id":25153,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":788,"end_offset":803},{"id":25155,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":863,"end_offset":903},{"id":25156,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":905,"end_offset":930},{"id":25157,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":984,"end_offset":987},{"id":25158,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1032,"end_offset":1043},{"id":25160,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1236,"end_offset":1265},{"id":25161,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1300,"end_offset":1338},{"id":25162,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1368,"end_offset":1387},{"id":25167,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":1621,"end_offset":1633},{"id":25169,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":1761,"end_offset":1785},{"id":25170,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1813,"end_offset":1816},{"id":25173,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1881,"end_offset":1897},{"id":25175,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":2016,"end_offset":2022},{"id":25179,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":2202,"end_offset":2213},{"id":25180,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":2407,"end_offset":2431},{"id":25182,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2463,"end_offset":2495},{"id":25184,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2581,"end_offset":2613},{"id":25189,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2771,"end_offset":2775},{"id":25191,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2948,"end_offset":2983},{"id":25192,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":3154,"end_offset":3186},{"id":25193,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":3188,"end_offset":3220},{"id":25195,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":3410,"end_offset":3425},{"id":25198,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":3501,"end_offset":3529},{"id":25194,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":3235,"end_offset":3264},{"id":25196,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":3427,"end_offset":3442},{"id":25197,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":3478,"end_offset":3481}],"relations":[{"id":12853,"from_id":25146,"to_id":25140,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":12855,"from_id":25151,"to_id":25140,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":12856,"from_id":25152,"to_id":25140,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":12857,"from_id":25153,"to_id":25140,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":12858,"from_id":25154,"to_id":25140,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":12861,"from_id":25169,"to_id":25170,"type":"surgery_for_R"},{"id":12863,"from_id":25178,"to_id":25180,"type":"surgery_on_R"},{"id":12866,"from_id":25199,"to_id":25200,"type":"surgery_on_R"},{"id":12867,"from

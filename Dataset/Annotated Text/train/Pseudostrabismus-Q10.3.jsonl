{"id":1950,"text":"#Diagnosis - Pseudostrabismus - Q10.3\nDiagnosis depends upon clinical history, physical examination and certain diagnostic tests. A good physical examination comprises of inspection of eye and adnexal morphology. Diagnostic tests: Visual acuity evaluation: Every patient presenting with pseudostrabismus should have complete evaluation of visual acuity. Motor evaluation: It comprises of tests such as: Hirschbergâ€™s light reflex test: This gives a rough objective estimate of the angle of manifest strabismus and is especially useful when fixation in the deviating eye is poor. Cover-uncover test: Cover test: This is done to detect heterotropia. Uncover test: It detects heterophoria. It is performed both for near and far. Alternate cover test: It is a dissociation test which reveals the total deviation when fusion is suspended. It is performed after the cover-uncover test. Ocular movements: It is necessary to test the function of each extra-ocular muscle by testing uniocular and binocular movements. Sensory evaluation: Complete sensory evaluation may give clue to sensory development. Detection of fixation preference for one eye may be performed by vertical prism test.","entities":[{"id":25401,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":30},{"id":25402,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":79,"end_offset":99},{"id":25403,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":231,"end_offset":255},{"id":25404,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":287,"end_offset":304},{"id":25405,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":354,"end_offset":370},{"id":25406,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":403,"end_offset":433},{"id":25407,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":578,"end_offset":596},{"id":25408,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":598,"end_offset":608},{"id":25409,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":633,"end_offset":645},{"id":25410,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":647,"end_offset":659},{"id":25411,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":672,"end_offset":684},{"id":25412,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":725,"end_offset":745},{"id":25413,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":879,"end_offset":895},{"id":25414,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1008,"end_offset":1026},{"id":25415,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1159,"end_offset":1178}],"relations":[{"id":12971,"from_id":25401,"to_id":25402,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12972,"from_id":25404,"to_id":25403,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12973,"from_id":25401,"to_id":25405,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12974,"from_id":25401,"to_id":25406,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12975,"from_id":25401,"to_id":25408,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12976,"from_id":25401,"to_id":25410,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12977,"from_id":25401,"to_id":25412,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12978,"from_id":25401,"to_id":25414,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12979,"from_id":25401,"to_id":25415,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

The most common form of pseudostrabismus is pseudoesotropia where the eyes appear crossed.

{"id":1954,"text":"#Treatment - Pseudostrabismus - Q10.3\nFor the common pseudoesotropia, since the nasal sclera part is being covered by the epicanthus, the orthotropic appearance may be demonstrated by pinching the nasal bridge slightly and revealing the nasal sclera. As the flat nasal bridge develops, this excessive epicanthal skin is raised and the condition corrects by itself. Hence, no treatment is required except for follow-up for disappearance of pseudoesotropia. Prognosis: The natural course of pseudostrabismus is variable.

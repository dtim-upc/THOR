Orbital haemangiopericytoma may undergo cystic changes within necrotic zones and may resemble the echo-graphic appearance of lymphangioma. Angiography: Angiography shows dilated feeding arteries, early tumour blush, and a rapid venous out flow. Haemangiopericytoma show rapid circulation with significant shunting of blood. CT and MR imaging: On CT and MR imaging, Tumour present as well defined mass with homogeneous enhancement. Histopathology: Tumour shows uniformly cellular pattern with a sinusoidal vascular component often forming branching (stag horn) channels. Reticulin forms a dense mesh around individual cells. Pericytes show staining for vimentin (protein seen in mesenchymally derived cells) only.","entities":[{"id":24069,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":40},{"id":24071,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":310,"end_offset":321},{"id":24075,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":367,"end_offset":385},{"id":24077,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":416,"end_offset":436},{"id":24079,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":602,"end_offset":616},{"id":24078,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":536,"end_offset":543},{"id":24080,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":618,"end_offset":625},{"id":24070,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":66,"end_offset":76},{"id":24072,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":495,"end_offset":512},{"id":24073,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":171,"end_offset":198},{"id":24074,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":341,"end_offset":365},{"id":24076,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":391,"end_offset":414}],"relations":[{"id":12245,"from_id":24069,"to_id":24079,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12244,"from_id":24069,"to_id":24072,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12243,"from_id":24069,"to_id":24071,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12242,"from_id":24069,"to_id":24070,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":1828,"text":"#Causes - Orbital Haemangiopericytoma - 2A00.5\nThere is controversy about the existence of haemangiopericytoma. Its derivation from pericytes is questioned and cases have been reclassified as solitary fibrous tumours, based on histopathologic and immune-histochemical findings. Traditionally, it has been categorised as vascular tumour. Orbital haemangiopericytoma is believed to originate from extra-vascular pericytes, morphologically resembling smooth muscles around capillaries or from primitive mesenchymal cells. The function of pericyte is uncertain, but is believed to provide mechanical support to the capillaries, and may be having contractile function.","entities":[{"id":24081,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":37},{"id":24085,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":293,"end_offset":296},{"id":24086,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":611,"end_offset":622},{"id":24087,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":455,"end_offset":481},{"id":24082,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":91,"end_offset":110},{"id":24084,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":337,"end_offset":364},{"id":24083,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":320,"end_offset":335},{"id":24098,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":490,"end_offset":517},{"id":24099,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":535,"end_offset":544}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1830,"text":"#Overview - Orbital Haemangiopericytoma - 2A00.5\nOrbital haemangiopericytoma is a rare soft-tissue neoplasm. This tumour originates from pericytes found around capillaries. Pericyte is a spindle shaped cell with a moderate amount of cytoplasm and an indistinct border. Routine histopathologic differentiation of pericyte from fibroblast, histiocyte and endothelial cell is difficult. Cellular differentiation may be best achieved by electron microscopy and immune-histochemistry.The function of pericytes is uncertain but is believed to provide mechanical support to the capillaries. Pericytes morphologically resemble smooth muscle. Besides the muscle cone of the eye, this tumour may also affect optic nerve meninges and lacrimal sac. This rare tumour is commonly encountered in lower extremities and retro-peritoneum.","entities":[{"id":24097,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":160,"end_offset":171},{"id":24094,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":39},{"id":24095,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":49,"end_offset":76},{"id":24096,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":109,"end_offset":120},{"id":24101,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":312,"end_offset":321},{"id":24102,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":326,"end_offset":336},{"id":24104,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":353,"end_offset":369},{"id":24106,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":571,"end_offset":582},{"id":24109,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":646,"end_offset":668},{"id":24110,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":670,"end_offset":681},{"id":24111,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":698,"end_offset":735},{"id":24100,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":173,"end_offset":182},{"id":24103,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":338,"end_offset":349},{"id":24105,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":495,"end_offset":505},{"id":24107,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":584,"end_offset":594},{"id":24108,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":626,"end_offset":632},{"id":24112,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":137,"end_offset":147}],"relations":[{"id":12251,"from_id":24110,"to_id":24111,"type":"affects_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":1831,"text":"#Treatment - Orbital Haemangiopericytoma - 2A00.5\nTreatment of the tumours is mainly surgical. Surgical therapy: Local Excision: Since these tumours usually have a pseudo-capsule, complete local excision is recommended, but it is also difficult because of friability. Exenteration: Tumours with aggressive local behaviour may require exenteration (complete surgical removal of the eyeball and all contents of the eye socket). Radiotherapy: Radiotherapy is not much of benefit and it may precipitate sarcomatous changes as well. Prognosis: Since even more histologically benign lesions may result in clinically invasive disease or malignant transformation, the aggressiveness of a particular lesion is difficult to predict. Therefore, this tumour warrants aggressive surgery and often adjuvant therapy.","entities":[{"id":24113,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":40},{"id":24115,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":113,"end_offset":127},{"id":24117,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":426,"end_offset":438},{"id":24114,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":95,"end_offset":111},{"id":24116,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":268,"end_offset":280},{"id":24118,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":528,"end_offset":537}],"relations":[{"id":12254,"from_id":24116,"to_id":24113,"type":"surgery_for_R"},{"id":12252,"from_id":24114,"to_id":24113,"type":"surgery_for_R"},{"id":12256,"from_id":24118,"to_id":24113,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":12255,"from_id":24117,"to_id":24113,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":12253,"from_id":24115,"to_id":24113,"type":"surgery_for_R"}],"Comments":[]}

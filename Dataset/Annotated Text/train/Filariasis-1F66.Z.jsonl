{"id":1000,"text":"#Causes - Filariasis - 1F66.Z\nMost cases of filariasis are caused by the parasite known as Wuchereria bancrofti.   Culex, Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes serve as vector for W.bancrofti in  transmission of the disease. Another parasite called Brugia malayi  also causes filariasis is transmitted by the vector Mansonia and Anopheles mosquitoes. When an infected mosquito bites a healthy person, the larvae called microfilariae move into the lymphatics and lymph nodes.  Here, they develop into adult worms and may persist for years. The adult parasite, in turn, produces more microfilariae. These microfilariae circulate in the peripheral blood usually in the night, and are sucked by the mosquitoes during a bite.   The same cycle is then repeated in another healthy individual.","entities":[{"id":14619,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":20},{"id":14621,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":91,"end_offset":111},{"id":14620,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":44,"end_offset":54},{"id":14622,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":115,"end_offset":152},{"id":14624,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":205,"end_offset":216},{"id":14625,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":242,"end_offset":255},{"id":14623,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":173,"end_offset":184},{"id":14626,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":269,"end_offset":279},{"id":14627,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":412,"end_offset":425},{"id":14631,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":575,"end_offset":588},{"id":14632,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":596,"end_offset":609},{"id":14633,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":627,"end_offset":643},{"id":14628,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":532,"end_offset":550}],"relations":[{"id":7007,"from_id":14620,"to_id":14621,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7008,"from_id":14624,"to_id":14623,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7009,"from_id":14624,"to_id":14622,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7010,"from_id":14626,"to_id":14625,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7012,"from_id":14619,"to_id":14628,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7013,"from_id":14619,"to_id":14631,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Blood collection should be done at night to coincide with the appearance of the microfilariae, and a thick smear should be made and stained with Giemsa or hematoxylin and eosin. For increased sensitivity, concentration techniques can be used. Serological examination: Serologic techniques provide an alternative to microscopic detection of microfilariae for the diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis. Patients with active filarial infection typically have elevated levels of antifilarial IgG4 in the blood and these can be detected using routine assays.

{"id":1075,"text":"#Diagnosis - Heterophoria - 9C80.4\nThere are different methods for diagnosis of heterophorias. Important tests in the evaluation of heterophoria include: Cover- Uncover test: It should be performed for both distance and near. One eye of the patient is covered while fixating with other eye at a distant target. Alternate cover test: The alternate cover test induces dissociation to reveal total deviation when fusion is disrupted. Maddox rod test: The Maddox rod consists of a series of fused cylindrical red glass rods that convert the appearance of a white spot of light in to a red streak. Maddox wing test: This is used to measure degree of heterophoria at near fixation. Synoptophore: This may also be used to measure degree of heterophoria. Near point of convergence: The near point of convergence is the nearest point on which the eyes can maintain binocular fixation. Near point of accommodation: The near point of accommodation is the nearest point on which the eyes can maintain clear focus. Measurement of fusion reserves: Fusion amplitudes measure the efficacy of vergence movements. Assessment of binocular vision.","entities":[{"id":15609,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":25},{"id":15610,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":80,"end_offset":93},{"id":15612,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":132,"end_offset":144},{"id":15613,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":154,"end_offset":173},{"id":15617,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":593,"end_offset":609},{"id":15611,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":67,"end_offset":76},{"id":15614,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":230,"end_offset":233},{"id":15615,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":311,"end_offset":331},{"id":15616,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":431,"end_offset":446},{"id":15618,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":645,"end_offset":657},{"id":15622,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":876,"end_offset":903},{"id":15619,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":676,"end_offset":688},{"id":15620,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":733,"end_offset":745},{"id":15621,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":747,"end_offset":772},{"id":15623,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1002,"end_offset":1032}],"relations":[{"id":7518,"from_id":15610,"to_id":15611,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":7520,"from_id":15609,"to_id":15615,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":7522,"from_id":15609,"to_id":15617,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":7523,"from_id":15620,"to_id":15619,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":7525,"from_id":15609,"to_id":15622,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":7519,"from_id":15612,"to_id":15613,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":7521,"from_id":15609,"to_id":15616,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":7524,"from_id":15609,"to_id":15621,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":7526,"from_id":15609,"to_id":15623,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1078,"text":"#Overview - Heterophoria - 9C80.4\nHeterophoria or latent squint is defined as a condition in which eyes in the primary position or in their movement are maintained on the fixation point under stress only, with the aid of corrective fusion reflexes. When the influence of fusion is removed, the visual axis of one eye deviates. George T Stevens (1886) introduced the term heterophoria and defined it as an abnormal adjustment of the eye muscles, or a tending of the visual lines in some other direction than parallelism, which applies to strabismus as well. In heterophoria binocular vision is habitually maintained, but by the expenditure of a greater amount of force than is demanded in the perfect equilibrium of the ocular muscles.","entities":[{"id":15640,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":24},{"id":15641,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":34,"end_offset":46},{"id":15644,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":313,"end_offset":316},{"id":15642,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":50,"end_offset":63},{"id":15643,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":99,"end_offset":103},{"id":15645,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":371,"end_offset":383},{"id":15646,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":405,"end_offset":443},{"id":15647,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":560,"end_offset":572},{"id":15648,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":715,"end_offset":733}],"relations":[{"id":7539,"from_id":15645,"to_id":15646,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":7540,"from_id":15647,"to_id":15648,"type":"affects_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Lesser degrees of heterophoria without any symptoms require no treatment except for correction of refractive error, if present. Orthoptics: This is the mainstay of treatment. Patients with moderate degrees of exophoria or esophoria who have fair degree of binocular function, orthoptic execises are the treatment of choice. Miotic drugs: Miotic drugs may be useful in near esophoria due to high AC\/A ratio. These facilitate peripheral accommodation so that less than normal innervation is required and consequently less than normal accommodative convergence occurs.

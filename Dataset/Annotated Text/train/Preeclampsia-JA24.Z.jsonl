{"id":1603,"text":"#Overview - Preeclampsia - JA24.Z\nPreeclampsia is one of the hypertensive (high blood pressure) disorders of pregnancy. It is a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality (number of stillbirths and deaths of newborn in the first week of life) and morbidity. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy occur in about 10% of all pregnant women around the world. Preeclampsia affects 3â€“5% of pregnancies. Along with preeclampsia, other diseases which are included in the group of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are eclampsia, gestational hypertension and chronic hypertension. In Asia and Africa, nearly one tenth of all maternal deaths are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. In India, the incidence of preeclampsia is reported to be 8-10% among the pregnant women. According to a study, the prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was 7.8% with preeclampsia in 5.4% of the study population in India*. Preeclampsia is a pregnancy specific hypertensive disease with multisystem involvement. It is a disorder of widespread vascular endothelial malfunction and vasospasm that occurs after 20 weeks of gestation and can present as late as 4-6 weeks postpartum (after child birth). According to the new guidelines given by American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG) in 2013, the diagnosis of preeclampsia does not require the detection of high levels of protein in the urine (proteinuria) along with hypertension. Evidence shows that changes in kidney and liver can occur without signs of proteinuria, and the amount of protein in the urine does not predict how severely the disease will progress.","entities":[{"id":21427,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":24},{"id":21428,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":34,"end_offset":46},{"id":21429,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":61,"end_offset":105},{"id":21430,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":120,"end_offset":122},{"id":21431,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":143,"end_offset":261},{"id":21432,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":263,"end_offset":285},{"id":21434,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":411,"end_offset":423},{"id":21435,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":515,"end_offset":524},{"id":21436,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":526,"end_offset":550},{"id":21433,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":358,"end_offset":370},{"id":21437,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":555,"end_offset":575}],"relations":[{"id":10743,"from_id":21428,"to_id":21429,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":10744,"from_id":21430,"to_id":21431,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

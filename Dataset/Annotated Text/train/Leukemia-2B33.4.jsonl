The generation of white cells increases in bone marrow (a hollow space in bones), where most blood particles are formed.  The increased numbers of abnormal white cells are immature and are called “Blasts”. There are two forms of leukaemia: Acute leukemia is identified by a rapid increase in the number of immature blood cells. Chronic leukemia is identified by the rapid increase of relatively mature, but still abnormal, white blood cells.","entities":[{"id":21924,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":310,"end_offset":319},{"id":21925,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":321,"end_offset":335},{"id":21928,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":447,"end_offset":521},{"id":21926,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":355,"end_offset":407},{"id":21927,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":409,"end_offset":425},{"id":21922,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":30,"end_offset":39},{"id":21921,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":21},{"id":21923,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":42,"end_offset":79}],"relations":[{"id":11036,"from_id":21922,"to_id":21923,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11037,"from_id":21925,"to_id":21926,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11038,"from_id":21927,"to_id":21928,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

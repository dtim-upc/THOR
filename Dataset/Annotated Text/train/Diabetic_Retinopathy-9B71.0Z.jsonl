Laboratory tests for Diabetic Retinopathy:  Fluorescein Angiography (FA): Fluorescein is a fluorescent dye. Fluorescein Angiography helps in assessing degree of retinal ischaemia and delineates retinal vascular abnormalities.  Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): OCT generates cross-sectional image of the retina with light. OCT helps in measuring retinal thickening. Periodic OCT determine whether the retinal thickening in macular area due to oedema is regressing or not with treatment. B-scan ultrasonography: B-scan ultrasonography evaluates retina when the media is not clear e.g. vitreous haemorrhage. Diabetic retinopathy should be distinguished from conditions like retinal vein occlusion, retinal vasculitis, sickle cell retinopathy or ocular ischaemic syndrome.","entities":[{"id":17280,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":33},{"id":17281,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":143,"end_offset":187},{"id":17284,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":358,"end_offset":381},{"id":17286,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":477,"end_offset":511},{"id":17287,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":513,"end_offset":517},{"id":17288,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":575,"end_offset":579},{"id":17291,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":739,"end_offset":761},{"id":17292,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":763,"end_offset":785},{"id":17293,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":796,"end_offset":803},{"id":17294,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":858,"end_offset":878},{"id":17295,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":836,"end_offset":856},{"id":17296,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":932,"end_offset":946},{"id":17297,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":948,"end_offset":966},{"id":17298,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":968,"end_offset":991},{"id":17299,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":995,"end_offset":1020},{"id":17282,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":271,"end_offset":291},{"id":17283,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":294,"end_offset":322},{"id":17285,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":411,"end_offset":474},{"id":17289,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":598,"end_offset":616},{"id":17290,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":618,"end_offset":630}],"relations":[{"id":8377,"from_id":17280,"to_id":17281,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":8379,"from_id":17280,"to_id":17286,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":8383,"from_id":17294,"to_id":17297,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":8384,"from_id":17294,"to_id":17298,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":8378,"from_id":17282,"to_id":17283,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":8380,"from_id":17280,"to_id":17290,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":8381,"from_id":17280,"to_id":17291,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":8382,"from_id":17294,"to_id":17296,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":8385,"from_id":17294,"to_id":17299,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":1198,"text":"#Overview - Diabetic Retinopathy - 9B71.0Z\nDiabetes mellitus is caused due to lack or diminished effectiveness of endogenous insulin and is characterised by hyperglycaemia. There are two broad types: Type I: This is known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). It is characterised by insulin deficiency. Usually it has juvenile onset but may occur at any age. Type II: This is known as non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or maturity onset diabetes mellitus. It occurs in middle aged\/ older people who are often obese. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterised by changes in retinal blood vessels that occur in patients with diabetes mellitus. Central retina or macular area is located between main superior and inferior retinal artery and vein. Diabetic retinopathy is broadly divided as: Background Diabetic retinopathy.

Proliferative Diabetic retinopathy (PDR).","entities":[{"id":17300,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":32},{"id":17303,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":157,"end_offset":171},{"id":17301,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":43,"end_offset":60},{"id":17302,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":78,"end_offset":132},{"id":17304,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":200,"end_offset":206},{"id":17305,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":225,"end_offset":267},{"id":17307,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":292,"end_offset":310},{"id":17309,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":394,"end_offset":441},{"id":17310,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":445,"end_offset":477},{"id":17312,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":532,"end_offset":537},{"id":17314,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":585,"end_offset":663},{"id":17306,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":269,"end_offset":272},{"id":17308,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":368,"end_offset":375},{"id":17311,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":479,"end_offset":482},{"id":17313,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":539,"end_offset":564},{"id":17315,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":665,"end_offset":695},{"id":17316,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":715,"end_offset":765},{"id":17317,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":767,"end_offset":787},{"id":17318,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":811,"end_offset":842},{"id":17319,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":844,"end_offset":882},{"id":17320,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":884,"end_offset":924}],"relations":[{"id":8386,"from_id":17306,"to_id":17307,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":8388,"from_id":17313,"to_id":17314,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":8387,"from_id":17311,"to_id":17312,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"}],"Comments":[]}

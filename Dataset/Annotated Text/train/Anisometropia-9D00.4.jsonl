{"id":397,"text":"#Diagnosis - Anisometropia - 9D00.4\nDiagnosis depends upon retinoscopic examination in patients with defective visual acuity. Clinical types of Anisometropia: Anisometropia may be absolute or relative. I. Absolute anisometropia: In this condition, refractive power of the two eyes is not equal. This is further divided into Simple anisometropia, Compound anisometropia, Mixed anisometropia, Simple astigmatic anisometropia, Compound astigmatic anisometropia. II. Relative anisometropia: It is that refractive anomaly in which although the total refraction of the two eyes is nearly equal, the component elements in each show relatively large differences. Visual status in anisometropia: There are various visual possibilities Binocular single vision, Amblyopia, Alternating vision, Strabismus. Tests for binocular vision: Binocular vision may be assessed by using FRIEND test or Worth’s four-dot test. I. FRIEND test: In this test, alternate letters are green and red in colour. Letters F, I and N are in green colour and the letters R, E and D are in red colour. This is available in Snellen’s distance vision chart. Patient is seated 6 meters from the Snellen’s chart and wears diplopia goggles with red glass in front of the right eye and green glass in front of the left eye. Patient then reads letters FRIEND on Snellen’s chart. II. Worth’s four-dot test: Patient wears diplopia goggles with red glass in front of the right eye and green glass in front of the left eye. Patient views Snellen’s distance vision chart having four dots of light viz. one red, two green and one white.","entities":[{"id":7065,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":27},{"id":7066,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":59,"end_offset":83},{"id":7067,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":144,"end_offset":157},{"id":7068,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":159,"end_offset":173},{"id":7069,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":205,"end_offset":227},{"id":7073,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":324,"end_offset":344},{"id":7074,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":346,"end_offset":368},{"id":7075,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":370,"end_offset":389},{"id":7076,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":391,"end_offset":422},{"id":7077,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":424,"end_offset":457},{"id":7078,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":463,"end_offset":485},{"id":7079,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":672,"end_offset":685},{"id":7080,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":794,"end_offset":800},{"id":7081,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":864,"end_offset":875},{"id":7082,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":879,"end_offset":900},{"id":7083,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":905,"end_offset":916},{"id":7084,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":926,"end_offset":930},{"id":7085,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1338,"end_offset":1359}],"relations":[{"id":3057,"from_id":7065,"to_id":7066,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3058,"from_id":7065,"to_id":7081,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3059,"from_id":7065,"to_id":7082,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":400,"text":"#Overview - Anisometropia - 9D00.4\nAnisometropia is an optical state with unequal refraction of the two eyes. The amount of spherical refractive error (myopia or hypermetropia) is usually about the same for both the eyes in most of the people. Generally, anisometropia is considered to exist if the refraction differs by 1.0 dioptres (D) or more for the two eyes. The measuring unit for refractive error is dioptre (D), which is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. Anisometropia is the most insidious refractive condition because it is often asymptomatic. The term antimetropia is used when one eye is myopic and the other is hypermetropic. Anisometropia due to refractive myopia or hypermetropia is known as refractive anisometropia and that due to axial ametropia is known as axial anisometropia. Anisometropia due to difference in refractive error along one meridian only is called meridional anisometropia.","entities":[{"id":7107,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":26},{"id":7108,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":35,"end_offset":49},{"id":7109,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":123,"end_offset":176},{"id":7110,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":255,"end_offset":269},{"id":7111,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":387,"end_offset":403},{"id":7112,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":486,"end_offset":500},{"id":7113,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":563,"end_offset":575},{"id":7114,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":586,"end_offset":599},{"id":7115,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":623,"end_offset":630},{"id":7116,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":647,"end_offset":660},{"id":7117,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":662,"end_offset":676},{"id":7118,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":694,"end_offset":701},{"id":7119,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":704,"end_offset":718},{"id":7120,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":730,"end_offset":754},{"id":7121,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":799,"end_offset":818},{"id":7122,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":820,"end_offset":834},{"id":7123,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":855,"end_offset":871},{"id":7124,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":906,"end_offset":930},{"id":7125,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":771,"end_offset":786}],"relations":[{"id":3074,"from_id":7112,"to_id":7113,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3075,"from_id":7114,"to_id":7115,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3078,"from_id":7117,"to_id":7119,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3079,"from_id":7121,"to_id":7125,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3080,"from_id":7122,"to_id":7123,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3076,"from_id":7114,"to_id":7116,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3077,"from_id":7117,"to_id":7118,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Medical therapy includes: Spectacles: The corrective glasses may be tolerated up to a maximum difference of 4 D in two eyes. A difference more than 4 D produces diplopia. In children younger than 12 years of age, where best visual correction is required in both the eyes, contact lenses are preferred. In adults, best correction may be prescribed which does not result in ocular discomfort. Contact lenses: Contact lenses are advised for higher degrees of anisometropia.

{"id":1822,"text":"#Causes - Orbital Solitary Fibrous Tumour - EE6Y\nOrbital solitary fibrous tumour is an uncommon benign spindle cell tumour with ultra structural and immuno-histochemical characteristics of mesenchymal fibroblast like cells. SFTs are presumed to arise from pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells that have the capacity to differentiate along endothelial, pericytic, or fibroblastic phenotypes, similar to normal angiogenesis. This may explain the presence of the characteristic haemangiopericytoma like vessels. Currently, there is no stain to identify specific lineage such as pericytic origin.","entities":[{"id":24026,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":41},{"id":24028,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":224,"end_offset":229},{"id":24027,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":49,"end_offset":80},{"id":24029,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":257,"end_offset":387}],"relations":[{"id":12218,"from_id":24028,"to_id":24029,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1824,"text":"#Overview - Orbital Solitary Fibrous Tumour - EE6Y\nOrbital Solitary Fibrous Tumour (SFT) is an uncommon benign spindle cell tumour with characteristics of mesenchymal fibroblast- like cells. It was originally recognised in the pleura. It is also seen in peritoneum, mediastinum, deep soft tissues of extremities, and conjunctiva as well. Orbital solitary fibrous tumour in orbit may involve intraconal or extraconal compartment, lacrimal sac, lacrimal gland fossa, and eyelids. It is possible that orbital SFTs were under diagnosed earlier because of its rarity in extra-pleural sites and histological similarity to other spindle-cell tumours.","entities":[{"id":24037,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":43},{"id":24038,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":51,"end_offset":88},{"id":24040,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":254,"end_offset":264},{"id":24041,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":266,"end_offset":277},{"id":24042,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":279,"end_offset":311},{"id":24044,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":338,"end_offset":369},{"id":24045,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":391,"end_offset":427},{"id":24046,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":429,"end_offset":441},{"id":24048,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":469,"end_offset":476},{"id":24049,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":498,"end_offset":510},{"id":24051,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":191,"end_offset":194},{"id":24039,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":227,"end_offset":233},{"id":24043,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":317,"end_offset":328},{"id":24047,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":443,"end_offset":463},{"id":24050,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":235,"end_offset":238}],"relations":[{"id":12225,"from_id":24044,"to_id":24046,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":12226,"from_id":24044,"to_id":24047,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":12230,"from_id":24050,"to_id":24041,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":12224,"from_id":24044,"to_id":24045,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":12227,"from_id":24044,"to_id":24048,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":12228,"from_id":24051,"to_id":24039,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":12229,"from_id":24050,"to_id":24040,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":12231,"from_id":24050,"to_id":24042,"type":"affects_R"}],"Comments":[]}

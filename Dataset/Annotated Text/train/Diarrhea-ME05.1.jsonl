It is usually the symptom of gastrointestinal infection, which can be caused by a variety of viral, parasitic and bacteria organisms.As per UNICEF report, diarrhoeal diseases account for nearly 1.3 million deaths a year among children under-five years of age making them the second most common cause of child deaths worldwide.","entities":[{"id":11199,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":20},{"id":11201,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":230,"end_offset":239},{"id":11202,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":335,"end_offset":361},{"id":11203,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":461,"end_offset":480},{"id":11200,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":43,"end_offset":52}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1018,"text":"#Causes - Downs Syndrome - LD40.0\nDown syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs as a result of an extra chromosome (chromosome 21). The additional genetic material causes physical and developmental characteristics associated with Down syndrome. There are three forms of Down syndrome, although the effects of each type are usually similar. Trisomy 21 is the most common type. Trisomy 21 is generally seen due to every cell in the body has an extra copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy is a Greek word that means ‘third copy’). Translocation is caused when a piece of chromosome 21 attaches itself to another chromosome in a cell. Mosaicism is the least common type. Here, only some of the cells have an extra copy of chromosome 21. People with mosaic Down syndrome may experience less delay with some aspects of their development.\n","entities":[{"id":14919,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":135,"end_offset":166},{"id":14920,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":233,"end_offset":246},{"id":14918,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":107,"end_offset":133},{"id":14790,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":34,"end_offset":47},{"id":14921,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":273,"end_offset":286},{"id":14923,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":379,"end_offset":389},{"id":14929,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":682,"end_offset":691},{"id":14922,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":343,"end_offset":353},{"id":14926,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":564,"end_offset":577},{"id":14927,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":605,"end_offset":625},{"id":14928,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":627,"end_offset":636},{"id":14930,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":714,"end_offset":727},{"id":14931,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":741,"end_offset":761},{"id":16657,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":524,"end_offset":538},{"id":16659,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":408,"end_offset":472}],"relations":[{"id":7166,"from_id":14920,"to_id":14919,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8070,"from_id":14923,"to_id":16659,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

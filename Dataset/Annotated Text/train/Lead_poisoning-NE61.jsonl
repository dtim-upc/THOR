{"id":1319,"text":"#Causes - Lead poisoning - NE61\nLead is a heavy metal with a bluish-grey colour. It has a low melting point, and can be combined with other metals to form alloys. It is widely used in products such as pipes; storage batteries; pigments and paints; glazes; vinyl products; weights, shot and ammunition; cable covers; and radiation shielding. Lead used for these purposes come from mined ores (primary) or from recycled scrap metal or batteries (secondary). Today, most of the lead in global commerce is secondary and is obtained from recycling lead-acid batteries. Improper recycling of used lead batteries causes environmental pollution and health damage. People can get exposure to lead mainly through inhalation and ingestion. Inhalation of lead particles generated by burning materials containing lead, for example, during smelting, recycling, stripping leaded paint, and using leaded gasoline or leaded aviation fuel; and air pollution by smoke arising from the open burning of waste and can transport lead for long distances. Ingestion of lead-contaminated dust, water (from leaded pipes), and food (from lead-glazed or lead-soldered containers), food chain.","entities":[{"id":18737,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":875,"end_offset":896},{"id":18738,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":900,"end_offset":920},{"id":18739,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1044,"end_offset":1066},{"id":18741,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1099,"end_offset":1150},{"id":18742,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1152,"end_offset":1162},{"id":18743,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":302,"end_offset":314},{"id":18740,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1068,"end_offset":1093},{"id":18744,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":743,"end_offset":804},{"id":18727,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":24},{"id":18728,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":201,"end_offset":206},{"id":18730,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":227,"end_offset":246},{"id":18731,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":248,"end_offset":254},{"id":18732,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":256,"end_offset":270},{"id":18735,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":320,"end_offset":339},{"id":18729,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":208,"end_offset":225},{"id":18733,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":272,"end_offset":300}],"relations":[{"id":9134,"from_id":18727,"to_id":18728,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9139,"from_id":18727,"to_id":18733,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9135,"from_id":18727,"to_id":18729,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9136,"from_id":18727,"to_id":18730,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9137,"from_id":18727,"to_id":18731,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9138,"from_id":18727,"to_id":18732,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9140,"from_id":18727,"to_id":18743,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9142,"from_id":18727,"to_id":18744,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9143,"from_id":18727,"to_id":18737,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9146,"from_id":18727,"to_id":18740,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9147,"from_id":18727,"to_id":18738,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9148,"from_id":18727,"to_id":18741,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9149,"from_id":18727,"to_id":18742,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9141,"from_id":18727,"to_id":18735,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9145,"from_id":18727,"to_id":18739,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1323,"text":"#Treatment - Lead poisoning - NE61\nMedical interventions and treatments vary depending on the confirmed blood lead level. Simply avoiding exposure to lead might be enough to reduce low levels of lead in blood. In more severe cases chelation therapy is recommended. In this treatment a medication given by mouth \/ injection binds with the lead so that it's excreted in urine. (While chelating agents can bind to lead in blood, they are ineffective in removing lead from the deep bone stores). Nutritional counseling is given about intake of foods containing calcium, iron and vitamin C. (Adequate iron is required to decrease lead absorption. Foods high in calcium will help to maintain adequate calcium bone stores and lead will not get stored in bones. Vitamin C is needed for the absorption of iron. Children with empty stomach absorb more lead than children with full stomachs).","entities":[{"id":18800,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":27},{"id":18801,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":203,"end_offset":208},{"id":18802,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":231,"end_offset":248},{"id":18819,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":492,"end_offset":584},{"id":18822,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":754,"end_offset":763}],"relations":[{"id":9182,"from_id":18802,"to_id":18800,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":9193,"from_id":18822,"to_id":18800,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":9192,"from_id":18819,"to_id":18800,"type":"prescribed_for_R"}],"Comments":[]}

When symptoms of lead poisoning appear they are non specific and cannot be differentiated. Lead can seriously affect health of children. Symptoms may be related to gastrointestinal system, central nervous system, musculoskeletal and cardiovascular system. Gastrointestinal symptoms are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, metallic taste. The combination of recurrent or intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting and constipation is commonly known as lead colic and should raise the suspicion of lead poisoning. Central nervous system-Lead affects children’s brain development resulting in reduced intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioural changes such as reduced attention span and increased antisocial behaviour, poor concentration, headache, fatigue, malaise, language and speech delay.

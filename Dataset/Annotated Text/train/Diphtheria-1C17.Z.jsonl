{"id":860,"text":"#Overview - Diphtheria - 1C17.Z\nDiphtheria is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheria, which primarily infects the throat and upper airways, and produces a toxin affecting other organs. One type of diphtheria affects the throat and sometimes the tonsils. Another type causes ulcers on the skin; these are more common in the tropics (places where all twelve months have mean temperatures of at least 18 Â°C). Diphtheria particularly affects the children aged 1 to 5 years of age. In temperate climates (have four seasons: summer, autumn, winter and spring) diphtheria tends to occur during the colder months.","entities":[{"id":12569,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":440,"end_offset":450},{"id":12570,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":588,"end_offset":598},{"id":12562,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":32,"end_offset":42},{"id":12564,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":126,"end_offset":217},{"id":12565,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":231,"end_offset":241},{"id":12566,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":250,"end_offset":260},{"id":12567,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":275,"end_offset":286},{"id":12561,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":22},{"id":12563,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":82,"end_offset":118},{"id":12568,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":308,"end_offset":326}],"relations":[{"id":5939,"from_id":12565,"to_id":12566,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":5940,"from_id":12565,"to_id":12567,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":5937,"from_id":12562,"to_id":12563,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5938,"from_id":12562,"to_id":12564,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"}],"Comments":[]}

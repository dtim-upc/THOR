Y. pestis is easily destroyed by sunlight, high temperatures, and disinfectants. Reservoir of infection: Wild rodents are the natural hosts of Y. pestis. At least 220 species of rodents which inhabit mountains, plains, deserts, cultivated fields and forests in both temperate and tropical climate are known to be infected with plague bacillus. Flea bites-Plague bacteria are mostly transmitted by bite of an infected flea. During plague epizootics (occurrence of disease at higher rates than expected, in animal population), many rodents die, and causing hungry fleas to seek other sources of blood. Contact with contaminated fluid or tissue: Humans can become infected when handling tissue or body fluids of a plague-infected animal without using proper precautions such as hunters.

Control of flea: destruction of rat fleas by proper application of an effective insecticide is most effective method to break the chain of transmission of disease. Control of rodents: Long term measures to control rodents should be based on improvement of sanitation in human dwellings and their vicinity.

{"id":1583,"text":"#Overview - Plague - 1B93.Z\nPlague is a communicable disease, caused by bacterium Yersinia pestis. It is one of the oldest diseases known to man and still occurs in the tropics, subtropics and warmer areas of temperate countries. Past outbreaks have shown that plague may reoccur in areas that have long remained silent. Plague is primarily a zoonotic disease (transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans) of wild rodents and man is affected incidentally. It is transmitted from one rodent to another by fleas (ectoparasites) and from animals to humans either by the bite of infected fleas, or direct contact, inhalation and rarely, ingestion of infective materials when handling infected hosts. Plague epidemics (unusually high occurrence of a disease in a population or area) have occurred in Africa, Asia, and South America but since the 1990s, most human cases have occurred in Africa. In 2013 there were 783 cases reported worldwide, including 126 deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO), 20 countries in Africa, America, and Asia are identified as natural foci for plague. The 3 most endemic countries are Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru. In Madagascar, outbreaks have occurred nearly every year since 1980. In India, outbreaks of plague occurred in Mamla village of district Beed, Maharashtra state (bubonic type) and district Surat in Gujarat state (pneumonic type) in September 1994. Subsequently, suspected cases of pneumonic plague were reported from Delhi, Varanasi, Karnataka and other states. A total of 876 cases and 54 deaths were reported. In 2002, outbreak of pneumonic plague occurred in Himachal Pradesh with 16 cases and 4 deaths. In 2004, outbreak of bubonic plague was reported from Dangud village, of district Uttar Kashi, Uttarakhand state with 8 cases & 3 deaths. The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi has identified four sylvatic foci (affecting wild animals) in India; the tri-junction of south India (Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu), Beed belt in Maharashtra, Rohru in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. NCDC is keeping routine surveillance in these areas. Weak health systems and low standards of environmental hygiene are risk factors for outbreaks of human plague. As with many primarily zoonotic diseases, plague is a very severe disease in people, with case fatality rates of 50-60% if left untreated.","entities":[{"id":21232,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":18},{"id":21233,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":28,"end_offset":34},{"id":21237,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":343,"end_offset":359},{"id":21238,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":321,"end_offset":327},{"id":21234,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":72,"end_offset":97},{"id":21235,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":99,"end_offset":101},{"id":21236,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":261,"end_offset":267},{"id":21239,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":462,"end_offset":464},{"id":21241,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":573,"end_offset":595},{"id":21242,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":600,"end_offset":614},{"id":21244,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":639,"end_offset":700},{"id":21245,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":702,"end_offset":708},{"id":21240,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":510,"end_offset":531},{"id":21243,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":616,"end_offset":626}],"relations":[{"id":10613,"from_id":21233,"to_id":21234,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10617,"from_id":21239,"to_id":21242,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10614,"from_id":21238,"to_id":21237,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":10615,"from_id":21239,"to_id":21240,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10616,"from_id":21239,"to_id":21241,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10618,"from_id":21239,"to_id":21243,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10619,"from_id":21239,"to_id":21244,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":1584,"text":"#Symptoms - Plague - 1B93.Z\nIncubation period (time taken between catching an infection and appearance of symptoms) of the disease is 3-7 days. Disease starts with flu like symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body-aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea. Depending on the route of infection, there are three forms of plague: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic. Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea usually on the lower extremities. Septicaemic plague occurs when infection spreads directly through the bloodstream without forming a “bubo\". Septicaemic plague may result from flea bites and from direct contact with infective materials through cracks in the skin. Pneumonic plague-or lung-based plague- It is less common form of plague and is caused by spread of infection to the lungs from advanced bubonic plague.","entities":[{"id":21264,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":674,"end_offset":740},{"id":21267,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":831,"end_offset":892},{"id":21265,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":742,"end_offset":779},{"id":21266,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":807,"end_offset":813},{"id":21250,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":213,"end_offset":219},{"id":21251,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":221,"end_offset":240},{"id":21253,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":255,"end_offset":263},{"id":21254,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":268,"end_offset":274},{"id":21256,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":346,"end_offset":380},{"id":21258,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":424,"end_offset":430},{"id":21259,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":448,"end_offset":509},{"id":21260,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":511,"end_offset":529},{"id":21261,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":542,"end_offset":617},{"id":21263,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":654,"end_offset":664},{"id":21246,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":18},{"id":21247,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":144,"end_offset":151},{"id":21248,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":164,"end_offset":167},{"id":21249,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":190,"end_offset":211},{"id":21252,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":245,"end_offset":253},{"id":21255,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":338,"end_offset":344},{"id":21257,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":382,"end_offset":396},{"id":21262,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":619,"end_offset":637}],"relations":[{"id":10624,"from_id":21247,"to_id":21251,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":10625,"from_id":21248,"to_id":21251,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":10628,"from_id":21247,"to_id":21253,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":10629,"from_id":21248,"to_id":21253,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":10630,"from_id":21247,"to_id":21254,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":10632,"from_id":21257,"to_id":21259,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10633,"from_id":21260,"to_id":21261,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10635,"from_id":21262,"to_id":21264,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10637,"from_id":21265,"to_id":21267,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":10620,"from_id":21247,"to_id":21249,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":10621,"from_id":21248,"to_id":21249,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":10622,"from_id":21247,"to_id":21250,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":10623,"from_id":21248,"to_id":21250,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":10626,"from_id":21247,"to_id":21252,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":10627,"from_id":21248,"to_id":21252,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":10631,"from_id":21248,"to_id":21254,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":10634,"from_id":21262,"to_id":21263,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

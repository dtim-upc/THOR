{"id":1175,"text":"#Overview - Hypertension - BA00.Z\nHypertension Hypertension, also known as high or raised blood pressure, is a condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure. Blood is carried from the heart to all parts of the body in the vessels. Each time the heart beats, it pumps blood into the vessels. Blood pressure is created by the force of blood pushing against the walls of blood vessels (arteries) as it is pumped by the heart. The higher the pressure in blood vessels the harder the heart has to work in order to pump blood. If left uncontrolled, hypertension can lead to a heart attack, an enlargement of the heart and eventually heart failure. Blood vessels may develop bulges (aneurysms) and weak spots due to high pressure, making them more likely to clog and burst. The pressure in the blood vessels can also cause blood to leak out into the brain. This can cause a stroke. Hypertension can also lead to kidney failure, blindness, rupture of blood vessels and cognitive impairment.","entities":[{"id":16817,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":34,"end_offset":46},{"id":16818,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":47,"end_offset":59},{"id":16821,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":183,"end_offset":188},{"id":16823,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":247,"end_offset":254},{"id":16825,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":307,"end_offset":314},{"id":16826,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":393,"end_offset":417},{"id":16827,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":441,"end_offset":446},{"id":16828,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":358,"end_offset":363},{"id":16831,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":539,"end_offset":544},{"id":16832,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":504,"end_offset":509},{"id":16834,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":568,"end_offset":580},{"id":16835,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":652,"end_offset":665},{"id":16816,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":24},{"id":16819,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":75,"end_offset":104},{"id":16820,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":134,"end_offset":147},{"id":16822,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":209,"end_offset":214},{"id":16824,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":270,"end_offset":275},{"id":16829,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":316,"end_offset":321},{"id":16830,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":475,"end_offset":488},{"id":16833,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":595,"end_offset":607},{"id":16836,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":631,"end_offset":636},{"id":16837,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":693,"end_offset":711},{"id":16838,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":716,"end_offset":747},{"id":16839,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":749,"end_offset":790},{"id":16840,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":667,"end_offset":684},{"id":16842,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":792,"end_offset":825},{"id":16843,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":841,"end_offset":873},{"id":16844,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":892,"end_offset":898},{"id":16845,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":900,"end_offset":912},{"id":16846,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":930,"end_offset":944},{"id":16847,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":946,"end_offset":955},{"id":16848,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":957,"end_offset":981},{"id":16849,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":986,"end_offset":1006}],"relations":[{"id":8145,"from_id":16818,"to_id":16820,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":8146,"from_id":16834,"to_id":16833,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":8147,"from_id":16834,"to_id":16836,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":8148,"from_id":16834,"to_id":16835,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":8149,"from_id":16845,"to_id":16846,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":8150,"from_id":16845,"to_id":16847,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":8151,"from_id":16845,"to_id":16848,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":8152,"from_id":16845,"to_id":16849,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

This is termed as primary prevention. It includes- 1. Healthy diet: promoting a healthy lifestyle with emphasis on proper nutrition for infants and young people; reducing salt intake to less than 5 g of salt per day (just under a teaspoon); eating five servings of fruit and vegetables a day; reducing saturated and trans fats and total fat intake. 2. Avoiding harmful use of alcohol i.e. limit intake to no more than one standard drink a day 3. Physical activity: Regular physical activity and promotion of physical activity for children and young people (at least 30 minutes a day five times a week). Maintaining a normal body weight: every 5 kg of excess weight lost can reduce systolic blood pressure by 2 to 10 points. 4. Stopping tobacco use and exposure to tobacco products. 5. Managing stress in healthy ways such as through meditation, appropriate physical exercise, and positive social contact.

{"id":1178,"text":"#Treatment - Hypertension - BA00.Z\nAntihypertensive Medicines- Antihypertensive drugs (drugs lowering the BP) work in several ways, such as removing excess salt and fluid from the body, slowing the heartbeat or relaxing and widening the blood vessels. Medicines to lower blood pressure include: Diuretics (Water or Fluid Pills): Flush excess sodium from the body, which reduces the amount of fluid in blood and helps to lower your blood pressure. Beta Blockers: Help heart to beat slower and with less force. As a result, heart pumps less blood through blood vessels, which can help to lower blood pressure. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors: Angiotensin-II is a hormone that narrows blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. ACE converts Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II. ACE inhibitors block this process, which stops the production of Angiotensin II, lowering blood pressure. Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs): Block angiotensin II hormone from binding with receptors in the blood vessels. When angiotensin II is blocked, the blood vessels do not constrict or narrow, which can lower your blood pressure. Calcium Channel Blockers: Keep calcium from entering the muscle cells of heart and blood vessels. This allows blood vessels to relax, which can lower blood pressure. Alpha Blockers: Reduce nerve impulses that tighten blood vessels. This allows blood to flow more freely, causing blood pressure to go down. Alpha-Beta Blockers: Reduce nerve impulses and also slow the heartbeat. As a result, blood pressure goes down. Central Acting Agents: Act in the brain to decrease nerve signals that narrow blood vessels, which can lower blood pressure. Vasodilators: Relax the muscles in blood vessel walls, which can lower blood pressure.","entities":[{"id":16879,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":63,"end_offset":109},{"id":16881,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":265,"end_offset":285},{"id":16882,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":237,"end_offset":250},{"id":16883,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":401,"end_offset":406},{"id":16884,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":447,"end_offset":460},{"id":16885,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":553,"end_offset":566},{"id":16886,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":586,"end_offset":606},{"id":16887,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":608,"end_offset":654},{"id":16889,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":656,"end_offset":670},{"id":16890,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":697,"end_offset":710},{"id":16877,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":25},{"id":16878,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":35,"end_offset":61},{"id":16880,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":295,"end_offset":327},{"id":16891,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":712,"end_offset":737},{"id":16892,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":739,"end_offset":742},{"id":16895,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":785,"end_offset":788},{"id":16899,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":996,"end_offset":1009},{"id":16901,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1016,"end_offset":1030},{"id":16903,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1183,"end_offset":1204},{"id":16904,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1209,"end_offset":1222},{"id":16906,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1292,"end_offset":1306},{"id":16908,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1343,"end_offset":1356},{"id":16909,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1432,"end_offset":1451},{"id":16910,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1370,"end_offset":1375},{"id":16913,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1577,"end_offset":1582},{"id":16914,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1668,"end_offset":1680},{"id":16915,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1692,"end_offset":1721},{"id":16916,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1614,"end_offset":1634},{"id":16919,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1276,"end_offset":1281},{"id":16893,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":752,"end_offset":765},{"id":16894,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":769,"end_offset":783},{"id":16896,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":850,"end_offset":864},{"id":16897,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":891,"end_offset":930},{"id":16898,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":938,"end_offset":960},{"id":16900,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1047,"end_offset":1060},{"id":16902,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1126,"end_offset":1150},{"id":16905,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1236,"end_offset":1249},{"id":16912,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1543,"end_offset":1564},{"id":16917,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1652,"end_offset":1657},{"id":16918,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1739,"end_offset":1744}],"relations":[{"id":8172,"from_id":16878,"to_id":16877,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":8173,"from_id":16879,"to_id":16877,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":8174,"from_id":16880,"to_id":16877,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":8175,"from_id":16884,"to_id":16877,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":8176,"from_id":16887,"to_id":16877,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":8177,"from_id":16897,"to_id":16877,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":8178,"from_id":16902,"to_id":16877,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":8179,"from_id":16906,"to_id":16877,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":8180,"from_id":16909,"to_id":16877,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":8181,"from_id":16912,"to_id":16877,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":8182,"from_id":16914,"to_id":16877,"type":"prescribed_for_R"}],"Comments":[]}

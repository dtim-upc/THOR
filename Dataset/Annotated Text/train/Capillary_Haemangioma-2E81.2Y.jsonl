{"id":431,"text":"#Overview - Capillary Haemangioma - 2E81.2Y\nAcquired Capillary Haemangioma of Eyelid (Cherry haemangioma, senile haemangioma) is a common skin lesion in middle aged and older patients. Virtually, it occurs in all adults at one time or the other. The lesions may be small and may be ignored. The number of haemangiomas varies from one to two in children to even up to hundred in some elderly patients. Most commonly it affects chest or extremities, but can occasionally affect eyelids and periocular area. It varies in size from being barely visible to a dome shaped bright red swellings about 5 mm in diameter.","entities":[{"id":7666,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":78,"end_offset":84},{"id":7664,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":33},{"id":7665,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":44,"end_offset":74},{"id":7667,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":86,"end_offset":104},{"id":7668,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":106,"end_offset":124},{"id":7672,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":138,"end_offset":149},{"id":7676,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":246,"end_offset":257},{"id":7679,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":305,"end_offset":317},{"id":7681,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":415,"end_offset":417},{"id":7683,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":426,"end_offset":431},{"id":7684,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":435,"end_offset":446},{"id":7685,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":476,"end_offset":483}],"relations":[{"id":3363,"from_id":7665,"to_id":7672,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3364,"from_id":7681,"to_id":7683,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":3366,"from_id":7681,"to_id":7685,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":3362,"from_id":7665,"to_id":7666,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":3365,"from_id":7681,"to_id":7684,"type":"affects_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":432,"text":"#Diagnosis - Capillary Haemangioma - 2E81.2Y\nClinically, solitary acquired capillary haemangioma of eyelid may present as a red to red-blue papule which may range from 0.5 to 5 mm in size. Smaller lesions are red in colour and the larger ones give a bluish appearance. These may become pedunculated with cherry-like surface irregularity, hence the name cherry haemangioma.

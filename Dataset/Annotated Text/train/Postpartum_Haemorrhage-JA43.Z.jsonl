During pregnancy, each pregnant woman should be investigated for anaemia and treated appropriately as this may reduce the occurrence and morbidity associated with PPH. Risk factors for PPH may present antenatally or intrapartum; hence birth preparedness and complication readiness (BPCR) plan must be prepared and may be modified as and when risk factors arise.

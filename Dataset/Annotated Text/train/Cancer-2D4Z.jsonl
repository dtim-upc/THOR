{"id":584,"text":"#Diagnosis - Cancer - 2D4Z\nCancers can generally be recognized by appearance of signs and symptoms through screening. Screening: Screening tests help in detecting cancer at an early stage (before the symptoms appear). When abnormal tissue or cancer is found early, it is easy to treat or cure. By the time symptoms appear, the cancer might have grown and spread. This can make the cancer harder to treat or cure. It is important to remember that when a doctor suggests any screening test, it does not always mean  that there is a  cancer. People with suspected cancer are investigated with medical tests. These tests include Blood tests, X-rays, MRIs, Biopsy, Pap-smears, CT scans and Endoscopy and many more.","entities":[{"id":9726,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":19},{"id":9729,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":107,"end_offset":116},{"id":9730,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":118,"end_offset":127},{"id":9735,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":377,"end_offset":387},{"id":9736,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":473,"end_offset":487},{"id":9738,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":561,"end_offset":567},{"id":9739,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":590,"end_offset":603},{"id":9740,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":625,"end_offset":636},{"id":9742,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":652,"end_offset":658},{"id":9745,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":685,"end_offset":694},{"id":9728,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":27,"end_offset":34},{"id":9731,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":129,"end_offset":144},{"id":9732,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":163,"end_offset":169},{"id":9733,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":223,"end_offset":248},{"id":9734,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":323,"end_offset":333},{"id":9737,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":531,"end_offset":537},{"id":9741,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":638,"end_offset":644},{"id":9743,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":660,"end_offset":670},{"id":9744,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":672,"end_offset":680}],"relations":[{"id":4426,"from_id":9732,"to_id":9731,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4427,"from_id":9728,"to_id":9729,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4430,"from_id":9726,"to_id":9740,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4431,"from_id":9726,"to_id":9741,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4432,"from_id":9726,"to_id":9742,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4433,"from_id":9726,"to_id":9743,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4434,"from_id":9726,"to_id":9744,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4428,"from_id":9737,"to_id":9736,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4429,"from_id":9738,"to_id":9739,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4435,"from_id":9726,"to_id":9745,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

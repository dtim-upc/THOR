It is worse on looking down and to the side opposite the lesion. In addition to the defect in eye movement, the affected eye produces characteristic head tilt away from the affected side. Fourth cranial nerve palsies are relatively uncommon. Isolated fourth cranial nerve palsy is the most common cause producing vertical diplopia.

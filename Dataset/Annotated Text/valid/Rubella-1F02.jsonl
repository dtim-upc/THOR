{"id":2087,"text":"#Overview - Rubella - 1F02\nRubella (also known as german measles) is a viral infection that used to be common in children. Rubella is usually a mild infection. It can be fatal usually with minimal systemic upset although transient arthropathy may occur in adults. Serious complications such as deterioration of the skin is very rare. Apart from the effects of transplacental infection on the developing fetus, rubella is a relatively trivial infection. Acquired (i.e. not congenital) rubella is transmitted via airborne droplet emission from the upper respiratory tract of active cases (can be passed along by the breath of people sick from Rubella). The virus may also be present in the urine, feces and on the skin.","entities":[{"id":26580,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":410,"end_offset":417},{"id":26582,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":453,"end_offset":491},{"id":26583,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":641,"end_offset":648},{"id":26584,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":651,"end_offset":660},{"id":26585,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":695,"end_offset":700},{"id":26575,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":19},{"id":26576,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":27,"end_offset":65},{"id":26577,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":123,"end_offset":130},{"id":26578,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":144,"end_offset":158},{"id":26579,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":294,"end_offset":319},{"id":26586,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":712,"end_offset":716},{"id":26587,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":546,"end_offset":570}],"relations":[{"id":13622,"from_id":26582,"to_id":26587,"type":"affects_R"}],"Comments":[]}

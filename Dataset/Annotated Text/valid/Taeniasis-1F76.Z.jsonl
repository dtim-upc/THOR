{"id":2181,"text":"#Causes - Taeniasis - 1F76.Z\nTaeniasis is intestinal infection caused by two species of tapeworms Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) and Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm). Taeniasis is acquired by humans through the ingestion of undercooked pork or beef, infected with cysticerci or contaminated food (mainly vegetables) and water. In the human body, cysticerci develop into adult tapeworms that live in the intestine and release egg-bearing gravid proglottids (segments) which are passed with faeces. Taeniasis and (neuro) cysticercosis are common in areas where animal husbandry practices are such that pigs and cattle come into contact with human faeces.","entities":[{"id":27705,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":73,"end_offset":163},{"id":27708,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":165,"end_offset":175},{"id":27693,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":20},{"id":27694,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":29,"end_offset":39},{"id":27701,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":42,"end_offset":62},{"id":27711,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":495,"end_offset":530},{"id":27712,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":344,"end_offset":355}],"relations":[{"id":14157,"from_id":27694,"to_id":27701,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14158,"from_id":27694,"to_id":27705,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Humans can get infected with two species of tapeworms-Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) and Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm). T.saginata has no major impact on human health while T. solium leads to neurocysticercosis-most severe form of the disease. Neurocysticercosis is a common cause of seizures; and the most frequent preventable cause of epilepsy worldwide.

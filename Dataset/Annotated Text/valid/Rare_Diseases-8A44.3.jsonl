{"id":2029,"text":"#Causes - Rare Diseases - 8A44.3\nThere are various causes of rare diseases, but still, the exact causes of many rare diseases are unknown. The common cause can be genetic, directly related with changes in genes or chromosomes. In some cases, genetic changes that cause disease are passed from one generation to the next. In other cases, genetic changes occur randomly in a person who is the first in a family with a rare disease.","entities":[{"id":26142,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":242,"end_offset":257},{"id":26138,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":23},{"id":26143,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":337,"end_offset":352},{"id":26144,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":416,"end_offset":428},{"id":26139,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":61,"end_offset":74},{"id":26140,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":112,"end_offset":125},{"id":26141,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":194,"end_offset":225}],"relations":[{"id":13413,"from_id":26144,"to_id":26143,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13412,"from_id":26138,"to_id":26141,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":2030,"text":"#Prevention - Rare Diseases - 8A44.3\nThe prevention of genetic disorders can be done at multiple levels. Primary Prevention aims at preventing the occurrence of the disease, i.e., preventing the birth of an affected child. Though not always feasible, this strategy yields the highest returns in terms of decreasing the incidence & prevalence of rare disorders in the population in the long run. Secondary prevention: This strategy focuses on avoiding the birth of the affected fetus (prenatal screening and prenatal diagnosis), early detection of the disorders, appropriate medical intervention to ameliorate or minimize the manifestations (newborn screening). Tertiary prevention refers to the provision of better care and medical rehabilitation to those rare disease patients who present at an advanced stage of the disease.","entities":[{"id":26145,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":14,"end_offset":27},{"id":26149,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":105,"end_offset":123},{"id":26150,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":395,"end_offset":415},{"id":26146,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":55,"end_offset":72},{"id":26147,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":132,"end_offset":221},{"id":26148,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":442,"end_offset":659},{"id":26151,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":661,"end_offset":680},{"id":26152,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":695,"end_offset":825}],"relations":[{"id":13419,"from_id":26145,"to_id":26152,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":13418,"from_id":26145,"to_id":26151,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":13417,"from_id":26145,"to_id":26148,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":13416,"from_id":26145,"to_id":26150,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":13415,"from_id":26145,"to_id":26147,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":13414,"from_id":26145,"to_id":26149,"type":"has_precaution_R"}],"Comments":[]}

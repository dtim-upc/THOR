Spatula test: It involves inserting a spatula into the back of the throat. If there is no infection, the spatula will cause a gag reflex and patient will try to push the spatula out of mouth. However, if the tetanus infection is present, the spatula will cause throat muscles to spasm and will bite down onto the spatula.","entities":[{"id":24976,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":20},{"id":24977,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":37,"end_offset":44},{"id":24979,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":179,"end_offset":191},{"id":24980,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":242,"end_offset":252},{"id":24983,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":364,"end_offset":369},{"id":24978,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":122,"end_offset":134},{"id":24982,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":383,"end_offset":404},{"id":24984,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":440,"end_offset":454}],"relations":[{"id":12780,"from_id":24979,"to_id":24980,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":12781,"from_id":24976,"to_id":24978,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12782,"from_id":24976,"to_id":24979,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12783,"from_id":24982,"to_id":24984,"type":"affects_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1897,"text":"#Overview - Tetanus - 1C13\nTetanus is a medical condition characterized by a prolonged contraction of skeletal muscle fibers. The primary symptoms are caused by tetanospasmin, a neurotoxin produced by the Gram-positive, rod-shaped, obligate anaerobic bacterium Clostridium tetani. The infection causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to \"locking\" of the jaw, which makes it impossible to open mouth or swallow. If this happens, person can die due to suffocation. It usually occurs when a flesh wound becomes contaminated. If it is not treated, tetanus may lead to complications, which can be fatal.","entities":[{"id":24998,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":19},{"id":25003,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":302,"end_offset":335},{"id":25007,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":505,"end_offset":507},{"id":24999,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":27,"end_offset":34},{"id":25000,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":77,"end_offset":124},{"id":25001,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":161,"end_offset":174},{"id":25002,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":241,"end_offset":279},{"id":25004,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":281,"end_offset":294},{"id":25005,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":481,"end_offset":503},{"id":25006,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":530,"end_offset":562},{"id":25008,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":456,"end_offset":460},{"id":25009,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":586,"end_offset":593}],"relations":[{"id":12791,"from_id":25004,"to_id":25003,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":12792,"from_id":25007,"to_id":25006,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":12793,"from_id":25008,"to_id":25005,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":12790,"from_id":24999,"to_id":25000,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

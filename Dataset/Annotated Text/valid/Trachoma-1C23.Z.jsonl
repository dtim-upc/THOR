{"id":2157,"text":"#Diagnosis - Solar Retinopathy - 9B62\nDiagnosis depends upon clinical history\/symptoms, manifesting signs, and investigations. Clinical signs. A small yellow spot with a grey margin may appear shortly after exposure in the foveolar or parafoveolar area. This disc shaped lesion is about 200Âµm in diameter which corresponds to retinal image of the sun. Mild cases may not show any lesion. Histopathology Acute solar lesion. Acute solar lesion shows injury to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) with necrosis, irregular pigmentation, and detachment. Photoreceptors show minimal change only. Weeks following acute damage. The yellow lesion is replaced by a permanent focal depression, with mottling of RPE or there may be lamellar hole. Vision may show some recovery, but scotoma and metamorphopsia may persist. Previous episodes of sun gazing show multiple areas of mottling in RPE. Fluorescein angiography may appear normal or may show transmission defects. There may be leakage of fluorescein dye in acute cases. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) shows disrupted reflectivity in outer retina, or fragmentation of highly reflective outer retina. Amsler grid testing may delineate small central or paracentral scotoma.","entities":[{"id":27397,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":30},{"id":27399,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":259,"end_offset":277},{"id":27402,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":388,"end_offset":402},{"id":27403,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":403,"end_offset":421},{"id":27404,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":423,"end_offset":441},{"id":27409,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":767,"end_offset":774},{"id":27410,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":779,"end_offset":793},{"id":27411,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":874,"end_offset":877},{"id":27412,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":879,"end_offset":902},{"id":27413,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1011,"end_offset":1045},{"id":27414,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1144,"end_offset":1163},{"id":27398,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":143,"end_offset":252},{"id":27406,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":458,"end_offset":544},{"id":27407,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":546,"end_offset":560},{"id":27408,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":697,"end_offset":700},{"id":27415,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1195,"end_offset":1214}],"relations":[{"id":14020,"from_id":27397,"to_id":27407,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":14019,"from_id":27404,"to_id":27406,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":14016,"from_id":27397,"to_id":27402,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":14015,"from_id":27397,"to_id":27398,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":14023,"from_id":27397,"to_id":27414,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":14022,"from_id":27397,"to_id":27413,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":14021,"from_id":27397,"to_id":27412,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":14017,"from_id":27397,"to_id":27403,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

The mechanism of damage is primarily photochemical. This may be potentiated by rise in tissue temperature. Increased chorioretinal pigmentation facilitates light absorption, which increases the background retinal temperature. Retinal defences are broken by supra-normal exposure to light. Retinal phototoxicity was originally believed to be a permanent damage, but some visual recovery has been seen. The extent of retinal injury and its possible recovery depends upon factors such as Area of exposed retina. Location of damage. Spectrum, intensity and duration of light exposure. Susceptibility of host. Emmetropia or hypermetropia due to effective focusing of light on retina.

{"id":2160,"text":"#Overview - Solar Retinopathy - 9B62\nSolar retinopathy (photo-retinitis, foveomacular retinitis, photomaculopathy, or eclipse retinopathy) is the retinal injury induced by direct or indirect exposure to light. Harmful effects of viewing sun are well recognised. Solar retinopathy may be due to looking at solar eclipse with or without telescope, sunbathing, religious gazing of sun, and use of psychotropic drugs. The effect of light on retina is being recognised since the time of Plato, who gave description of eclipse blindness. Photic (related to light) retinopathy is a generalised term used for retinal damage produced by light. This may be due to solar viewing or may be produced even by the use of operating microscope. Photo-retinitis damages the retina through photochemical effects, associated with rise in temperature. Sustained viewing of sun for more than 90 seconds through a constricted pupil may exceed the threshold for damage of retinal tissues.","entities":[{"id":27431,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":29},{"id":27435,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":73,"end_offset":95},{"id":27436,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":97,"end_offset":113},{"id":27438,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":146,"end_offset":208},{"id":27439,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":262,"end_offset":279},{"id":27440,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":414,"end_offset":443},{"id":27442,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":728,"end_offset":751},{"id":27444,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":831,"end_offset":963},{"id":27432,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":37,"end_offset":54},{"id":27433,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":56,"end_offset":71},{"id":27437,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":118,"end_offset":137}],"relations":[{"id":14031,"from_id":27432,"to_id":27438,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":2172,"text":"#Overview - Traumatic Hyphaema - NA06.9\nTraumatic Hyphaema is the accumulation of blood in the anterior chamber of eye following trauma. Trauma is the most common cause of hyphaema. Traumatic hyphaema may occur following both blunt and penetrating injuries. A ruptured iris root blood vessel generally causes bleeding. Hyphaema may affect vision by blocking the visual axis. Hyphaema may also be a sign of associated damage to intraocular tissues. Damage to intraocular tissues may be the cause of poor vision in spite of resolution of hyphaema.","entities":[{"id":27618,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":40,"end_offset":58},{"id":27617,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":30},{"id":27622,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":221,"end_offset":256},{"id":27626,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":375,"end_offset":384},{"id":27629,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":498,"end_offset":544},{"id":27619,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":137,"end_offset":144},{"id":27620,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":172,"end_offset":180},{"id":27621,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":182,"end_offset":200},{"id":27623,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":258,"end_offset":291},{"id":27624,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":309,"end_offset":317},{"id":27625,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":319,"end_offset":328},{"id":27627,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":417,"end_offset":446},{"id":27628,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":448,"end_offset":477}],"relations":[{"id":14108,"from_id":27621,"to_id":27622,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14109,"from_id":27626,"to_id":27627,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":2173,"text":"#Diagnosis - Traumatic Hyphaema - NA06.9\nClinical history and examination may help in identification of most hyphaemas. Upright posture of patient at an angle of 30Â° allows the hyphaema to settle at a fluid level. Size and shape of hyphaema is recorded daily, so as to assess its resolution or secondary haemorrhage, if it occurs. Daily assessment of visual acuity and pupillary reactions help in assessment of progress of medical management. Applanation tonometry to record intraocular pressure is deferred, unless elevated intraocular pressure is suspected. Fundus examination is also postponed till the media is clear, barring few exceptions. B- Scan can be done, if retinal detachment is suspected.","entities":[{"id":27631,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":41,"end_offset":73},{"id":27633,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":177,"end_offset":186},{"id":27635,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":331,"end_offset":388},{"id":27630,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":31},{"id":27632,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":109,"end_offset":118},{"id":27634,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":232,"end_offset":241},{"id":27636,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":646,"end_offset":653}],"relations":[{"id":14110,"from_id":27632,"to_id":27631,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":14111,"from_id":27630,"to_id":27636,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

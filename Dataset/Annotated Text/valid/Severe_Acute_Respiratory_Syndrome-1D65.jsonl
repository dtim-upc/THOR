{"id":2093,"text":"#Diagnosis - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - 1D65\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR): It can detect genetic material of the SARS-CoV in various specimens like blood, stool, respiratory secretions or body tissues Sampling for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) diagnostic tests. ELISA (Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbant Assay): A test detecting a mixture of IgM and IgG antibodies in the serum of SARS patients yields positive results reliably at around day 21 after the onset of illness. IFA (Immunofluorescence Assay): A test detecting IgM antibodies in serum of SARS patients yields positive results after about day 10 of illness. This test format is also used to test for IgG. This is a reliable test requiring the use of fixed SARS virus on an immunofluorescence microscope. Positive antibody test results indicate a previous infection with SARS-CoV. Seroconversion from negative to positive or a four-fold rise in antibody titre from acute to convalescent serum indicates recent infection. Negative antibody test results: No detection of antibody after 21 days from onset of illness seems to indicate that no infection with SARS-CoV took place.","entities":[{"id":26619,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":46},{"id":26621,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":125,"end_offset":133},{"id":26622,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":160,"end_offset":165},{"id":26624,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":285,"end_offset":326},{"id":26625,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":397,"end_offset":401},{"id":26628,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":732,"end_offset":736},{"id":26629,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":846,"end_offset":854},{"id":26630,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1130,"end_offset":1138},{"id":26620,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":54,"end_offset":85},{"id":26623,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":226,"end_offset":266},{"id":26626,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":489,"end_offset":519},{"id":26627,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":565,"end_offset":569}],"relations":[{"id":13639,"from_id":26619,"to_id":26620,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13641,"from_id":26625,"to_id":26624,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13642,"from_id":26627,"to_id":26626,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

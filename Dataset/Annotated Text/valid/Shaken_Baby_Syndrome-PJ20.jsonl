Serious injuries in infants, notably those causing death, are rarely accidental unless there is a clear cause for the injuries, such as road traffic accident due to motor vehicle. The majority of all cases of SBS are limited to children under three years of age.

{"id":1849,"text":"#Diagnosis - Shaken Baby Syndrome - PJ20\nDiagnostic procedures: Radiological examination: Skeletal survey should include radiographs of hands, feet, long bones, skull, spine and ribs. Scintigraphy: Scintigraphy is a nuclear medicine test which detects areas of increased or decreased bone metabolism, thus increase sensitivity of detecting rib fractures. Computed tomography (CT scan): CT scan has primary role in imaging evaluation of a child with TBI. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI optimizes detection and assessment of intracranial injury including parenchymal haemorrhage, contusions, oedema and shearing injuries. Spinal tap: If a spinal tap yields bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a fluid which is xanthochromic (yellowish appearance of CSF) should arouse suspicion that the cerebral trauma may be several hours old and the blood in CSF is not from traumatic spinal tap. Laboratory studies for SBS are nonspecific and are not diagnostic. Leukocytosis is seen in about 50% of cases. Serum chemistry findings are usually normal, but it may reveal evidence of acidosis.","entities":[{"id":24235,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":33},{"id":24237,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":136,"end_offset":141},{"id":24238,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":143,"end_offset":147},{"id":24242,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":178,"end_offset":182},{"id":24243,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":184,"end_offset":196},{"id":24245,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":284,"end_offset":288},{"id":24246,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":340,"end_offset":353},{"id":24247,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":355,"end_offset":384},{"id":24236,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":64,"end_offset":88},{"id":24239,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":149,"end_offset":159},{"id":24240,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":161,"end_offset":166},{"id":24241,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":168,"end_offset":173},{"id":24244,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":216,"end_offset":237},{"id":24249,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":449,"end_offset":452},{"id":24251,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":530,"end_offset":549},{"id":24252,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":560,"end_offset":583},{"id":24253,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":585,"end_offset":595},{"id":24254,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":597,"end_offset":603},{"id":24248,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":386,"end_offset":393},{"id":24250,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":454,"end_offset":486},{"id":24255,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":608,"end_offset":625},{"id":24256,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":627,"end_offset":637},{"id":24258,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":790,"end_offset":805},{"id":24257,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":644,"end_offset":654},{"id":24259,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":909,"end_offset":912}],"relations":[{"id":12318,"from_id":24236,"to_id":24239,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":12319,"from_id":24236,"to_id":24240,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":12322,"from_id":24243,"to_id":24245,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":12326,"from_id":24235,"to_id":24244,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12327,"from_id":24235,"to_id":24247,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12328,"from_id":24235,"to_id":24250,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12329,"from_id":24235,"to_id":24256,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12316,"from_id":24236,"to_id":24237,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":12317,"from_id":24236,"to_id":24238,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":12320,"from_id":24236,"to_id":24241,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":12321,"from_id":24236,"to_id":24242,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":12323,"from_id":24249,"to_id":24248,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12324,"from_id":24235,"to_id":24236,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12325,"from_id":24235,"to_id":24243,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

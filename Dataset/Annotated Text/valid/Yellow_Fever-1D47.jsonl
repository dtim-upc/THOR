The causative agent is virus   of the Flavivirus genus. Yellow fever mainly occurs in sub-Saharan Africa (countries to the south of the Sahara desert), South America and in parts of the Caribbean. There are two forms of yellow fever: Urban and Jungle. Clinically and etiologically they are identical.","entities":[{"id":26232,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":32,"end_offset":44},{"id":26235,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":182,"end_offset":198},{"id":26237,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":364,"end_offset":376},{"id":26231,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":24},{"id":26233,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":58,"end_offset":73},{"id":26234,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":98,"end_offset":142},{"id":26236,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":200,"end_offset":212}],"relations":[{"id":13463,"from_id":26232,"to_id":26234,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":13462,"from_id":26232,"to_id":26233,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":2043,"text":"#Prevention - Yellow Fever - 1D47\nYellow fever can be prevented by taking vaccination against it. A single injection of yellow fever vaccine given subcutaneously provides immunity to 100% of its recipients. The vaccine provides immunity only after 10 days of vaccination. It confers lifelong immunity to people residing in  yellow fever endemic countries. However, booster dose is required every ten years by persons residing in non endemic countries. The vaccine is contraindicated in persons allergic to egg, hypersensitive to previous dose, pregnant females, children younger than 9 months of age or with compromised immune diseases. The vaccine can be accompanied with mild side effects like fever, soreness, redness or swelling where the shot was given. These side effects usually subside within a week.","entities":[{"id":26259,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":67,"end_offset":96},{"id":26261,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":324,"end_offset":336},{"id":26257,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":14,"end_offset":26},{"id":26258,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":34,"end_offset":46},{"id":26260,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":98,"end_offset":140},{"id":26265,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":696,"end_offset":757}],"relations":[{"id":13478,"from_id":26257,"to_id":26260,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":13477,"from_id":26258,"to_id":26259,"type":"has_precaution_R"}],"Comments":[]}

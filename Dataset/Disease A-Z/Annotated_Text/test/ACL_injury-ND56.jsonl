{"id":55,"text":"#Treatment - ACL injury - ND56.Z\nPrompt first-aid care can reduce pain and swelling immediately after an injury to your knee. Follow the rest, ice, compression, elevation (R.I.C.E.) model of self-care at home: Rest. General rest is necessary for healing and limits weight bearing on your knee. Ice. When you're awake, try to ice your knee at least every two hours for 20 minutes at a time. Compression. Wrap an elastic bandage or compression wrap around your knee. Elevation. Lie down with your knee propped up on pillows. Rehabilitation. Medical treatment for an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury begins with several weeks of rehabilitative therapy. A physical therapist will teach you exercises that you will perform either with continued supervision or at home. You may also wear a brace to stabilize your knee and use crutches for a while to avoid putting weight on your knee. The goal of rehabilitation is to reduce pain and swelling, restore your knee's full range of motion, and strengthen muscles. This course of physical therapy may successfully treat an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury for individuals who are relatively inactive, engage in moderate exercise and recreational activities, or play sports that put less stress on the knees. Surgery. Your doctor may recommend surgery if: You're an athlete and want to continue in your sport, especially if the sport involves jumping, cutting or pivoting, More than one ligament or the fibrous cartilage in your knee also is injured, The injury is causing your knee to buckle during everyday activities. During anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, the surgeon removes the damaged ligament and replaces it with a segment of tendon — tissue similar to a ligament that connects muscle to bone. This replacement tissue is called a graft. Your surgeon will use a piece of tendon from another part of your knee or a tendon from a deceased donor. After surgery you'll resume another course of rehabilitative therapy. Successful anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction paired with rigorous rehabilitation can usually restore stability and function to your knee. There's no set time frame for athletes to return to play. Recent research indicates that up to one-third of athletes sustain another tear in the same or opposite knee within two years. A longer recovery period may reduce the risk of re-injury. In general, it takes as long as a year or more before athletes can safely return to play. Doctors and physical therapists will perform tests to gauge your knee's stability, strength, function and readiness to return to sports activities at various intervals during your rehabilitation. It's important to ensure that strength, stability and movement patterns are optimized before you return to an activity with a risk of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.

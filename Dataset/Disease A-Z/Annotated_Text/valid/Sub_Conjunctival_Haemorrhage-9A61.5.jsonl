{"id":2132,"text":"#Symptoms - Sub Conjunctival Haemorrhage - 9A61.5\nSub-conjunctival haemorrhage is usually asymptomatic and present as a flat sheet of homogeneous red colour having well- defined limits. The collection of bright smooth blood is confined to a sector of the bulbar conjunctiva, and is sharply demarcated at the limbus. The posterior limit of haemorrhage is visible in sub-conjunctival haemorrhage due to local trauma to the eyeball. The posterior limit is not visible in haemorrhages due to orbital injury. A large haemorrhage may track into the eyelids. During absorption of haemorrhage, the colour changes from bright red to orange and then yellow. Some pigmentation may be left behind in severe cases of haemorrhage. Sometimes, there may be momentary sharp pain or a snapping or popping sensation. Vision is usually unaffected, but substantially elevated haemorrhage with Dellen formation on cornea may affect vision.","entities":[{"id":27010,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":40},{"id":27012,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":120,"end_offset":184},{"id":27013,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":186,"end_offset":314},{"id":27014,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":365,"end_offset":393},{"id":27016,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":316,"end_offset":361},{"id":27017,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":504,"end_offset":550},{"id":27019,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":717,"end_offset":796},{"id":27011,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":50,"end_offset":78},{"id":27015,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":401,"end_offset":428},{"id":27018,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":552,"end_offset":646}],"relations":[{"id":13837,"from_id":27011,"to_id":27012,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13842,"from_id":27010,"to_id":27017,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13838,"from_id":27010,"to_id":27013,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13840,"from_id":27014,"to_id":27016,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13841,"from_id":27014,"to_id":27015,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13843,"from_id":27010,"to_id":27018,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13844,"from_id":27010,"to_id":27019,"type":"has_symptom_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":2134,"text":"#Diagnosis - Sub Conjunctival Haemorrhage - 9A61.5\nDiagnosis of sub-conjunctival haemorrhage is mainly clinical. There is acute and painless redness of bleeding beneath conjunctiva in the absence of discharge or inflammation. It may produce dot haemorrhages to extensive areas of bleeding. Sub-conjunctival haemorrhage is most often seen in temporal and inferior parts of conjunctiva, but trauma causes localised haemorrhage. Histology: Histologically, sub-conjunctival haemorrhage lies between conjunctiva and episclera, and the blood elements are found in the substantia propria of the conjunctiva when a sub-conjunctival vessel breaks.","entities":[{"id":27025,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":122,"end_offset":224},{"id":27026,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":290,"end_offset":318},{"id":27029,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":403,"end_offset":424},{"id":27032,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":487,"end_offset":520},{"id":27023,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":41},{"id":27024,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":64,"end_offset":92},{"id":27027,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":341,"end_offset":383},{"id":27028,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":389,"end_offset":396},{"id":27030,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":426,"end_offset":435},{"id":27031,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":453,"end_offset":481}],"relations":[{"id":13846,"from_id":27031,"to_id":27030,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13845,"from_id":27026,"to_id":27027,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":13847,"from_id":27031,"to_id":27032,"type":"affects_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":2220,"text":"#Causes - Vitiligo - ED63.0\nVitiligo is caused by the lack of a skin pigment called melanin. It may be further associated with the conditions: Autoimmune Conditions: Non-segmental vitiligo, the most common type of vitiligo, is thought to be an autoimmune condition. This means that the immune system (the body’s natural defense system) does not work properly. Instead of attacking foreign cells, such as viruses, immune system produces antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) that attack the body’s own healthy cells and tissue. Neurochemicals: Segmental vitiligo, the less common type of vitiligo, is thought to be caused by chemicals released from the nerve endings in the skin. These chemicals are poisonous to the melanocyte skin cells.","entities":[{"id":28181,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":286,"end_offset":299},{"id":28173,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":18},{"id":28174,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":28,"end_offset":36},{"id":28177,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":54,"end_offset":91},{"id":28179,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":166,"end_offset":188},{"id":28180,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":413,"end_offset":426},{"id":28182,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":504,"end_offset":517},{"id":28183,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":522,"end_offset":528},{"id":28184,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":546,"end_offset":564},{"id":28185,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":590,"end_offset":598},{"id":28186,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":627,"end_offset":680},{"id":28187,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":214,"end_offset":222}],"relations":[{"id":14398,"from_id":28184,"to_id":28186,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":14396,"from_id":28174,"to_id":28177,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":2221,"text":"#Overview - Vitiligo - ED63.0\nIt is a condition that causes pale, white patches to develop on skin (de pigmentation of the skin). Vitiligo can affect any area of  the skin, but most commonly occurs on skin exposed to the sun, such as   face, neck and hands. The condition varies from person to person. It occurs when melanocytes, the cells responsible for skin pigmentation, die or are unable to function. The cause of vitiligo is unknown, but research suggests that it may arise from autoimmune, genetic, oxidative stress, neural, or viral causes.

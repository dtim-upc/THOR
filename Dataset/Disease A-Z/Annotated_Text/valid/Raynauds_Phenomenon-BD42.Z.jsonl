{"id":2070,"text":"#Overview - Raynauds Phenomenon - BD42.Z\nIt is a vasospastic disorder causing discoloration of the fingers, toes and occasionally other areas. It is a condition that leads to brittle nails with longitudinal ridges. Raynaud's phenomenon includes Raynaud's disease (also known as \"Primary Raynaud's phenomenon\") where the phenomenon is idiopathic. Raynaud's phenomenon is an exaggeration of vasomotor responses to cold or emotional stress. Specifically, it is a hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system causing vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels, leading to tissue hypoxia. Chronic, recurrent cases of Raynaud's phenomenon can result in atrophy of the skin, subcutaneous tissues, and muscle. In rare cases it can cause ulceration and ischemic gangrene.","entities":[{"id":26419,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":31},{"id":26421,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":215,"end_offset":235},{"id":26423,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":279,"end_offset":307},{"id":26424,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":346,"end_offset":366},{"id":26428,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":452,"end_offset":454},{"id":26430,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":658,"end_offset":677},{"id":26420,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":78,"end_offset":141},{"id":26422,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":245,"end_offset":262},{"id":26425,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":483,"end_offset":509},{"id":26426,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":518,"end_offset":566},{"id":26427,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":568,"end_offset":593},{"id":26429,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":623,"end_offset":643},{"id":26432,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":679,"end_offset":711}],"relations":[{"id":13554,"from_id":26429,"to_id":26432,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":13552,"from_id":26428,"to_id":26426,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":13549,"from_id":26428,"to_id":26425,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":13548,"from_id":26419,"to_id":26420,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":13553,"from_id":26429,"to_id":26430,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":13550,"from_id":26428,"to_id":26426,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) test:This blood test checks for antinuclear antibodies in blood. These antibodies are produced by  immune system and attack body's own tissues.

{"id":2100,"text":"#Overview - Tooth Sensitivity - DA08.Y\nDentinal Hypersensitivity is commonly known as tooth sensitivity. If a person feels mild to severe discomfort or pain on consuming hot, cold, or sweet food and drinks or breathing in cold air, it indicates sensitive teeth. It is a very common clinical presentation and causes considerable concern for patients. Studies showed that in most populations, 10-30% of the general population suffer from dentinal hypersensitivity.","entities":[{"id":26664,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":29},{"id":26666,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":86,"end_offset":103},{"id":26667,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":117,"end_offset":230},{"id":26665,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":39,"end_offset":64},{"id":26668,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":245,"end_offset":260},{"id":26669,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":436,"end_offset":461}],"relations":[{"id":13663,"from_id":26668,"to_id":26667,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13662,"from_id":26666,"to_id":26665,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":2101,"text":"#Treatment - Tooth Sensitivity - DA08.Y\nThe type of treatment will depend on the cause of sensitivity. Sensitivity takes some time to settle. Treatment includes use of desensitizing toothpastes for use at home; or topical application of desensitizing agents by dentists. These desensitizing agents contain compounds that prevent irritants from stimulating the nerves inside the tooth. Most widely used ingredient is potassium nitrate. Other effective desensitizing agent are dentin sealers (resins), sodium citrate, and sodium monofluorophosphate. In office treatments are fluoride varnishes, or fluoride gel application, fillings, crowns, inlays or bonding, that can be used to repair the damaged areas of the tooth or to cover the areas exposed by gum recession. Invasive procedures include gingival graft surgery or root canal treatment.","entities":[{"id":26670,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":30},{"id":26674,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":475,"end_offset":498},{"id":26675,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":500,"end_offset":514},{"id":26676,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":520,"end_offset":546},{"id":26677,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":573,"end_offset":591},{"id":26678,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":596,"end_offset":620},{"id":26679,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":622,"end_offset":630},{"id":26681,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":640,"end_offset":657},{"id":26682,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":793,"end_offset":815},{"id":26671,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":90,"end_offset":101},{"id":26672,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":161,"end_offset":209},{"id":26673,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":214,"end_offset":269},{"id":26680,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":632,"end_offset":638},{"id":26683,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":819,"end_offset":839}],"relations":[{"id":13664,"from_id":26672,"to_id":26670,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":13667,"from_id":26675,"to_id":26670,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":13669,"from_id":26677,"to_id":26670,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":13670,"from_id":26678,"to_id":26670,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":13671,"from_id":26679,"to_id":26670,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":13675,"from_id":26682,"to_id":26670,"type":"surgery_for_R"},{"id":13665,"from_id":26673,"to_id":26670,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":13666,"from_id":26674,"to_id":26670,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":13668,"from_id":26676,"to_id":26670,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":13672,"from_id":26680,"to_id":26670,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":13673,"from_id":26681,"to_id":26670,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":13674,"from_id":26683,"to_id":26670,"type":"prescribed_for_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":2102,"text":"#Causes - Tooth Sensitivity - DA08.Y\nToothbrush abrasion: Brushing too hard, and brushing from side to side, causes enamel wear, making freshly exposed dentine sensitive. Dental erosion: It is loss of tooth enamel due to attacks of acid from acidic food and drinks. If enamel is worn away, the dentine underneath is exposed which may lead to sensitivity. Gum disease: A build-up of plaque or tartar can cause the gum to recede down the tooth and even destroy the bony support of the tooth. Tooth grinding: A habit which involves clenching and grinding of the teeth. This also causes the teeth enamel to be worn away, making the teeth sensitive. A cracked tooth or filling: a cracked tooth\/filling is the one that has broken.

Brushing too hard, applying too much pressure while brushing or using a hard-bristled toothbrush causes tooth abrasions and gingival recessions leading to tooth sensitivity. The American Dental Association recommends to follow a good dental care routine: Brushing teeth gently twice a day with a soft-bristled toothbrush and a fluoridated toothpaste. Donâ€™t brush your teeth from side to side.

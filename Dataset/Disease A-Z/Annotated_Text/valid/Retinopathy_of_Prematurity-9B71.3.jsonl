{"id":2075,"text":"#Causes - Retinopathy of Prematurity - 9B71.3\nRetinopathy of prematurity occurs in pre-term infants born before the normal growth of retinal blood vessels. Like other retinopathies, local ischaemia of retina plays a role in ROP. Excessive oxygen exposure causes obliteration of blood vessels in immature retina. Oxygen saturation maintained at lower level from birth can reduce the rate of advancement of ROP. Foetus in uterus is in hypoxic state as compared to life after birth. In pre-term infants, growth of retinal vessels is stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, on exposure of immature retina to oxygen, the blood vessel constricts and can become obliterated resulting in delay of normal retinal vascular growth. This is the stage of hyperoxia-vasocessation. Initially, the retina derives oxygen by diffusion from the underlying capillary bed of choroidal layer. The retina continues to grow in thickness and outgrows its vascular supply. But over the time, avascular retina becomes ischaemic and stimulates VEGF leading to hypoxia-vasoproliferation stage and manifest as arterio-venous shunts and neovascularisation. Infants at risk are screened with appropriate timing of examination and follow up.","entities":[{"id":26467,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":405,"end_offset":408},{"id":26469,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":420,"end_offset":426},{"id":26471,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":544,"end_offset":585},{"id":26472,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":642,"end_offset":654},{"id":26474,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":901,"end_offset":907},{"id":26475,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1042,"end_offset":1046},{"id":26460,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":36},{"id":26462,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":167,"end_offset":180},{"id":26464,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":224,"end_offset":227},{"id":26468,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":410,"end_offset":416},{"id":26470,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":511,"end_offset":526},{"id":26473,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":768,"end_offset":791},{"id":26476,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1058,"end_offset":1089},{"id":26461,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":46,"end_offset":72},{"id":26463,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":182,"end_offset":207},{"id":26465,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":229,"end_offset":254},{"id":26466,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":262,"end_offset":310}],"relations":[{"id":13579,"from_id":26460,"to_id":26476,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13577,"from_id":26460,"to_id":26471,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13578,"from_id":26460,"to_id":26473,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13576,"from_id":26460,"to_id":26466,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13575,"from_id":26460,"to_id":26465,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13574,"from_id":26464,"to_id":26463,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":2076,"text":"#Overview - Retinopathy of Prematurity - 9B71.3\nRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP), previously called retrolental fibroplasia, is a vaso-proliferative retinopathy which affects premature infants exposed to high concentration of oxygen. Retinopathy of prematurity often regresses but has the potential of causing visual impairment or blindness. ROP causes disorganised growth of retinal blood vessels which may lead to retinal scarring or even detachment of retina. Retina has no blood vessels until fourth month of gestation. Thereafter, vessels emanate from hyaloid vessels at the optic disc and progress towards periphery. These vessels reach nasal periphery after eight months of gestation, but do not reach temporal periphery until about one month after delivery. Incompletely vascularised temporal part of retina is particularly susceptible to damage with oxygen therapy, particularly in premature infants. Pre-term birth affects normal retinal vascular maturation. Exposure to oxygen down-regulate retinal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), resulting in constriction\/obliteration of blood vessels and delays normal retinal vascular development.","entities":[{"id":26477,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":38},{"id":26479,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":100,"end_offset":123},{"id":26486,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":477,"end_offset":490},{"id":26487,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":536,"end_offset":551},{"id":26488,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":557,"end_offset":572},{"id":26491,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1010,"end_offset":1051},{"id":26492,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1095,"end_offset":1108},{"id":26478,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":48,"end_offset":80},{"id":26480,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":130,"end_offset":160},{"id":26481,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":234,"end_offset":260},{"id":26482,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":342,"end_offset":345},{"id":26483,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":310,"end_offset":340},{"id":26484,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":353,"end_offset":461},{"id":26485,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":463,"end_offset":469},{"id":26489,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":623,"end_offset":636},{"id":26490,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":809,"end_offset":815}],"relations":[{"id":13581,"from_id":26482,"to_id":26484,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":13580,"from_id":26481,"to_id":26483,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Zone 1: It includes a circular area bounded by an imaginary circle, radius which is twice the distance from optic disc to macula.

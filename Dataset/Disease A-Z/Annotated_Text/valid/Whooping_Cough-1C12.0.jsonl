The symptoms of whooping cough usually take between six to twenty days to appear after infection with the bordetella pertussis bacterium.

{"id":2056,"text":"#Overview - Whooping Cough - 1C12.0\nWhooping cough is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs. It is also known as pertussis. Pertussis is known for uncontrollable, violent coughing which often makes it hard to breathe. After fits of many coughs, someone with pertussis often needs to take deep breathes which result in a \"whooping\" sound. Pertussis most commonly affects infants and young children and can be fatal, especially in babies less than 1 year of age.","entities":[{"id":26306,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":26},{"id":26308,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":56,"end_offset":106},{"id":26309,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":108,"end_offset":111},{"id":26310,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":128,"end_offset":137},{"id":26311,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":139,"end_offset":149},{"id":26314,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":273,"end_offset":283},{"id":26315,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":353,"end_offset":363},{"id":26307,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":36,"end_offset":50},{"id":26312,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":162,"end_offset":194},{"id":26313,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":216,"end_offset":231}],"relations":[{"id":13499,"from_id":26307,"to_id":26308,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":13501,"from_id":26311,"to_id":26313,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":13500,"from_id":26311,"to_id":26312,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

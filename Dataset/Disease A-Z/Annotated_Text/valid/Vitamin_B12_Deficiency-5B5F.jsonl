{"id":2200,"text":"#Causes - Vitamin B12 Deficiency - 5B5F\nThe exact cause is not known, but disease is associated with certain risks factors which include: Age – Pernicious anemia is most common at later age. Gender – Pernicious anemia affects slightly more women than men. Family history – nearly a third of people with anemia also have a family member with the condition. Autoimmune condition, such as Addison’s disease or vitiligo – is also associated with anemia and other autoimmune conditions. Diet- The body generally stores vitamin B12 to last approximately two to four years. However, it is important to have vitamin B12 in the diet to ensure  the store is kept at a healthy level. Conditions affecting the stomach- Some stomach conditions or stomach operations can also prevent the absorption of  vitamin B12. For example, a gastrectomy(a surgical procedure where part of stomach is removed) also increases risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. Conditions affecting the intestines- Some conditions that affect intestines (part of the digestive system). For example, Crohn’s disease (a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system) can sometimes result in body not able to absorb enough vitamin B12. Folate deficiency anaemia. Folate is a water-soluble vitamin (it dissolves in water), as a result body is unable to store it for long periods of time. Body stores folate that last four months. This means one need folate in daily diet to ensure body has sufficient stores of the vitamin. Diet- Not having enough folate in daily diet. Mal absorption- Sometimes body is unable to absorb folate as effectively as it should. This is usually the result of an underlying condition affecting digestive system, such as Coeliac disease. Excessive urination- Body may lose folate from body if one urinate frequently. This can be caused by an underlying condition that affects one of the organs, such as your kidneys or liver.","entities":[{"id":27932,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":180,"end_offset":189},{"id":27940,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":442,"end_offset":448},{"id":27952,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":817,"end_offset":883},{"id":27966,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1070,"end_offset":1172},{"id":27980,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1241,"end_offset":1266},{"id":27989,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1574,"end_offset":1588},{"id":27992,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1768,"end_offset":1787},{"id":27993,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1938,"end_offset":1945},{"id":27931,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":32},{"id":27934,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":240,"end_offset":245},{"id":27935,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":144,"end_offset":161},{"id":27936,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":200,"end_offset":217},{"id":27937,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":303,"end_offset":309},{"id":27938,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":386,"end_offset":415},{"id":27946,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":673,"end_offset":705},{"id":27954,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":918,"end_offset":947},{"id":27986,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1534,"end_offset":1572},{"id":27991,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1751,"end_offset":1766},{"id":27994,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1949,"end_offset":1954}],"relations":[{"id":14254,"from_id":27935,"to_id":27932,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":14266,"from_id":27931,"to_id":27966,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":14287,"from_id":27931,"to_id":27989,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":14297,"from_id":27931,"to_id":27992,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":14255,"from_id":27936,"to_id":27934,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":14256,"from_id":27940,"to_id":27938,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":14259,"from_id":27931,"to_id":27946,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":14265,"from_id":27954,"to_id":27952,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":14283,"from_id":27931,"to_id":27986,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"}],"Comments":[]}

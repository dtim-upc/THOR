During infection the immune system fights the infection by producing antibodies to proteins on the surface of the bacteria. Streptococcus pyogenes causes a wide variety of diseases in humans. It is one of the most common causes of acute bacterial pharyngitis that leads to RF\/RHD. Impetigo, a common skin infection, is also caused by S. pyogenes and is associated with acute glomerulonephritis (AGN). In rare cases, S. pyogenes causes invasive diseases such as cellulitis, bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, and toxic shock syndrome (TSS).","entities":[{"id":25962,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":72,"end_offset":152},{"id":25959,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":33},{"id":25960,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":43,"end_offset":58},{"id":26000,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":488,"end_offset":553},{"id":25980,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":278,"end_offset":300},{"id":25987,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":310,"end_offset":344},{"id":25996,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":385,"end_offset":468},{"id":26003,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":570,"end_offset":581},{"id":26004,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":589,"end_offset":692}],"relations":[{"id":13346,"from_id":25959,"to_id":25980,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13347,"from_id":25959,"to_id":26000,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13348,"from_id":25959,"to_id":26003,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13345,"from_id":25960,"to_id":25962,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

These include fever, arthralgia (generalised joint aches), blood tests that suggest general illness (elevated ESR), and changes seen on electrocardiogram (Increased P-R interval).

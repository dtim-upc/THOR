{"id":2142,"text":"#Overview - Substance abuse - 6C4Z\nSubstance abuse refers to the harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illicit drugs. The use of psychoactive substances causes significant health and social problems for the people who use them, and also for others in their families and communities. Substances of abuse include alcohol, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, hallucinogens, prescription and over-the-counter drug abuse. (Psychoactive substances are substances that, when taken in or administered into one's system, affect mental processes). Psychoactive substance use poses a significant threat to the health, social and economic aspects of families, communities and nations.  Globally, the prevalence of alcohol use disorders is significantly higher than the prevalence of drug use disorders. Generally, alcohol and drug use disorders are more common among males than among females. According to the World Health Organisation Report 2002 (WHO),  8.9% of the total burden of disease  is due to use of psychoactive substances; tobacco accounted for 4.1%, alcohol 4%, and illicit drugs 0.8% of the burden of disease .There are  2 billion alcohol users, 1.3 billion smokers and 185 million drug users globally (WHO 2002). These three psychoactive substances have different disease burden on different age groups. Illicit drug use causes mortality earliest in life, alcohol also mainly (65%) before the age of 60, while 70% of the tobacco deaths occur after the age of 60.","entities":[{"id":27092,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":35,"end_offset":50},{"id":27095,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":154,"end_offset":189},{"id":27098,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":366,"end_offset":373},{"id":27104,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":571,"end_offset":597},{"id":27105,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":717,"end_offset":756},{"id":27109,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1364,"end_offset":1390},{"id":27091,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":27},{"id":27094,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":65,"end_offset":153},{"id":27096,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":348,"end_offset":355},{"id":27097,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":357,"end_offset":364},{"id":27099,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":375,"end_offset":387},{"id":27100,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":389,"end_offset":402},{"id":27101,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":404,"end_offset":416},{"id":27102,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":421,"end_offset":442},{"id":27103,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":320,"end_offset":339},{"id":27106,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":804,"end_offset":822},{"id":27107,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":835,"end_offset":865},{"id":27108,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1031,"end_offset":1054},{"id":27110,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1340,"end_offset":1352}],"relations":[{"id":13890,"from_id":27103,"to_id":27102,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":13888,"from_id":27103,"to_id":27100,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":13887,"from_id":27103,"to_id":27099,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":13889,"from_id":27103,"to_id":27101,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":13886,"from_id":27103,"to_id":27098,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":13885,"from_id":27103,"to_id":27097,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":13884,"from_id":27103,"to_id":27096,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":13883,"from_id":27092,"to_id":27094,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

The ASSIST can be completed in about five to ten minutes and can be incorporated into the normal consultation at primary health care services. A list of substances such as tobacco products, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), sedatives and sleeping pills (benzodiazepines), hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, ‘other’ drugs are included in the screening test. The ASSIST obtains information from persons about lifetime use of substances, and use of substances and associated problems over the last 3 months. It can identify a range of problems associated with substance use including acute intoxication, regular use, dependent or ‘high risk’ use and injecting behaviour. The ASSIST determines a risk score for each substance. The score obtained for each substance falls into a ‘lower‘, ‘moderate’ or ‘high’ risk category which determines the most appropriate intervention for that level of use (‘no treatment’, ‘brief intervention’ or ‘referral to specialist assessment and treatment’ respectively).","entities":[{"id":27117,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":28},{"id":27120,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":409,"end_offset":425},{"id":27122,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":436,"end_offset":444},{"id":27123,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":446,"end_offset":453},{"id":27125,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":490,"end_offset":536},{"id":27127,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":553,"end_offset":562},{"id":27129,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":627,"end_offset":633},{"id":27130,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":847,"end_offset":865},{"id":27131,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":823,"end_offset":836},{"id":27133,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":689,"end_offset":699},{"id":27134,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":712,"end_offset":722},{"id":27118,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":190,"end_offset":235},{"id":27119,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":241,"end_offset":247},{"id":27121,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":427,"end_offset":434},{"id":27124,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":455,"end_offset":488},{"id":27126,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":538,"end_offset":551},{"id":27128,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":564,"end_offset":571},{"id":27132,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":938,"end_offset":944},{"id":27135,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":978,"end_offset":987},{"id":27136,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1017,"end_offset":1026}],"relations":[{"id":13893,"from_id":27131,"to_id":27130,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13892,"from_id":27117,"to_id":27118,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":2146,"text":"#Risk Factor - Substance abuse - 6C4Z\nRisk factors- Some risk factors that can influence a child for later substance abuse and other problems have their presence during different developmental periods of life. Many risk factors are related and tend to cluster together. Following are the various risk factors: Prenatal period: Smoking and drinking alcohol during pregnancy can affect a developing fetus with altered growth and physical development and cognitive impairments in the child. Infancy and childhood: Insecure attachment during the child’s first year of life can cause a child to be aggressive or withdrawn and have difficulty interacting with other children or adults. Uncontrolled aggression during early childhood can lead to poor social skills and problems during preschool period. Lack of classroom structure in the school environment can lead to additional social and behavioral problems in children and academic failure. At the same time, they may be exposed to greater availability of drugs, drug abusers, and social activities involving drugs. These challenges can increase the risk that they will abuse alcohol, tobacco, and other substances. Parental abuse and neglect are commonly seen as part of the cause of drug abuse. An adolescent or pre-adolescent may be trying to gain attention from an inattentive parent or escape an abusive one by using drugs; prolonged attempts through drug use can be a cause of drug abuse. Parental substance use can also affect child both directly and indirectly by disturbing family environment and poor parenting. There are increased chances of child abuse and neglect in such families.","entities":[{"id":27154,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":15,"end_offset":30},{"id":27155,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":107,"end_offset":122},{"id":27160,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":680,"end_offset":726},{"id":27162,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1107,"end_offset":1161},{"id":27164,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1376,"end_offset":1440},{"id":27156,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":310,"end_offset":325},{"id":27157,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":327,"end_offset":372},{"id":27158,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":488,"end_offset":509},{"id":27159,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":511,"end_offset":568},{"id":27161,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":796,"end_offset":936},{"id":27163,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1163,"end_offset":1242},{"id":27165,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1442,"end_offset":1460}],"relations":[{"id":13914,"from_id":27154,"to_id":27164,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":13913,"from_id":27154,"to_id":27163,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":13912,"from_id":27154,"to_id":27161,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":13911,"from_id":27154,"to_id":27160,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":13910,"from_id":27154,"to_id":27159,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":13908,"from_id":27154,"to_id":27157,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":13907,"from_id":27154,"to_id":27156,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":13915,"from_id":27154,"to_id":27165,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":13909,"from_id":27154,"to_id":27158,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Patients require long-term and repeated episodes of care to achieve the ultimate goal of sustained abstinence and recovery. Principles of effective treatment should be: Substance abuse is treatable. Treatment varies depending on the type of drug and the characteristics of the patients. Treatment needs to be readily available. Effective treatment must address the individual drug abuse and any associated medical, psychological, social, vocational and legal problems. Behavioral therapies including individual, family, or group counseling are the most commonly used forms of drug abuse treatment. Medications are an important element of treatment for many patients (such as alcohol, nicotine, heroin or other opioids), especially when combined with counseling and other behavioral therapies. An individual's treatment and services plan must be assessed continually and modified as necessary to ensure that it meets his or her changing needs.

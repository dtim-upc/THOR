It is a slender spirochete that is serologically indistinguishable from the spirochete T.pallidium which causes syphilis. The agents found in the epidermis of the lesions, lymph glands, spleen and bone marrow. The organism rapidly dies outside the tissues. Reservoir of infection- Man is the only known reservoir of yaws. Clinical lesions relapse 2-3 times or more during the first 5 years of infections and serve as source for new infections. The most latent cases are found in clusters centered around an infectious case. There are frequent relapses in latent cases. Transmission-Yaws is transmitted through direct (person-to-person), non-sexual contact with the fluid from the lesion of an infected person to an uninfected persons through minor injuries. Most lesions occur on the limbs. The initial lesion of yaws is filled with the bacteria. The incubation period is 9–90 days (average 21 days). About 75% of people affected are children under 15 years old (peak incidence occurs in children aged 6–10 years). Males and females are equally affected. Overcrowding, poor hygiene and poor socioeconomic conditions favours the spread of the yaws","entities":[{"id":28589,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":86,"end_offset":97},{"id":28590,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":99,"end_offset":101},{"id":28593,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":245,"end_offset":269},{"id":28594,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":271,"end_offset":283},{"id":28595,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":285,"end_offset":307},{"id":28596,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":415,"end_offset":419},{"id":28597,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":343,"end_offset":354},{"id":28599,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":736,"end_offset":832},{"id":28600,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":681,"end_offset":685},{"id":28602,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":862,"end_offset":869},{"id":28603,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":912,"end_offset":916},{"id":28604,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":936,"end_offset":944},{"id":28591,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":186,"end_offset":197},{"id":28592,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":211,"end_offset":219},{"id":28598,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":689,"end_offset":734},{"id":28601,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":883,"end_offset":888},{"id":28605,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1241,"end_offset":1245},{"id":28586,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":14},{"id":28587,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":22,"end_offset":26},{"id":28588,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":40,"end_offset":58}],"relations":[{"id":14626,"from_id":28587,"to_id":28589,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":14627,"from_id":28590,"to_id":28592,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14630,"from_id":28602,"to_id":28601,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":14631,"from_id":28603,"to_id":28604,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":14628,"from_id":28600,"to_id":28598,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":14629,"from_id":28600,"to_id":28599,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":14625,"from_id":28587,"to_id":28588,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Yaws is a chronic contagious non-venereal disease, belongs to a group of chronic bacterial infections (endemic treponematoses, nonvenereal spirochetal diseases) caused by treponemes. (Other diseases belonging to this group are bejel (endemic syphilis) and pinta). Yaws is the most common of all and occurs primarily in the warm, humid and tropical areas of Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Indian peninsula and the equatorial islands of South-East Asia. Yaws is caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. Yaws is not a fatal disease, but causes disabilities and visible deformities of the face and extremities contributing to stigma and discrimination. It affects the skin, bone and cartilage; if left untreated it can lead to deformities of the nose and bones of the leg. However, the disease can be cured and prevented by a single dose of antibiotics. In India cases were first reported among tea plantation labourers in Assam in1887. Later on cases occurred in Orissa, Chattishgarh, Madhya Pradesh and other areas.","entities":[{"id":28607,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":24,"end_offset":28},{"id":28608,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":30,"end_offset":34},{"id":28609,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":201,"end_offset":211},{"id":28610,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":294,"end_offset":298},{"id":28612,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":395,"end_offset":420},{"id":28614,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":437,"end_offset":453},{"id":28618,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":519,"end_offset":557},{"id":28619,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":559,"end_offset":563},{"id":28621,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":616,"end_offset":647},{"id":28622,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":652,"end_offset":705},{"id":28623,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":707,"end_offset":709},{"id":28626,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":737,"end_offset":746},{"id":28627,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":766,"end_offset":768},{"id":28606,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":16},{"id":28611,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":353,"end_offset":393},{"id":28613,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":422,"end_offset":435},{"id":28615,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":459,"end_offset":499},{"id":28616,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":501,"end_offset":505},{"id":28620,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":599,"end_offset":611},{"id":28624,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":722,"end_offset":726},{"id":28625,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":728,"end_offset":732},{"id":28628,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":781,"end_offset":825},{"id":28629,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":836,"end_offset":847},{"id":28630,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":895,"end_offset":906}],"relations":[{"id":14633,"from_id":28610,"to_id":28611,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":14634,"from_id":28610,"to_id":28612,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":14635,"from_id":28610,"to_id":28613,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":14637,"from_id":28610,"to_id":28615,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":14639,"from_id":28619,"to_id":28620,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14640,"from_id":28619,"to_id":28621,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14641,"from_id":28619,"to_id":28622,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14644,"from_id":28623,"to_id":28626,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":14636,"from_id":28610,"to_id":28614,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":14638,"from_id":28616,"to_id":28618,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":14642,"from_id":28623,"to_id":28624,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":14643,"from_id":28623,"to_id":28625,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":14645,"from_id":28627,"to_id":28628,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14646,"from_id":28630,"to_id":28629,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":14632,"from_id":28608,"to_id":28609,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

In early yaws, an initial papilloma (a circular, solid swelling on the skin, with no visible fluid) develops at the site of entry of the bacterium. This papilloma is full of organisms and may persist for 3–6 months followed by natural healing. Nocturnal bone pain and bone lesions may also occur in the early stage. These primary skin lesions (Early Yaws) usually occur in children and adolescents in endemic areas. Late yaws appears after 5 years of the initial infection and is characterized by disfigurement of the nose and bones, and thickening and cracking of the palms of the hand and soles of the feet. These complications on the soles of the feet make it difficult for patients to walk.

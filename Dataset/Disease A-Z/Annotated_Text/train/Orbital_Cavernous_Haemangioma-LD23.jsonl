{"id":1678,"text":"#Diagnosis - Orbital Cavernous Haemangioma - LD23\nCavernous haemangioma represents an angiographically silent venous malformation consisting of vascular spaces lined with endothelium and bound by a pseudo-capsule. These are separated by connective tissue that contains smooth muscle. It may contain phleboliths. Frank haemorrhage is atypical, but hemosiderin staining may occur. Investigations Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Cavernous haemangioma mostly shows low T1 signal and high T2 signal with variable enhancement. Dynamic post gadolinium MRI shows progressive spread of enhancement from a single point or small component of the mass. This is a characteristic feature of Cavernous haemangioma. This helps in monitoring of tumours where conservative approach is considered instead of surgical therapy. Computerised axial tomography (CAT): It may show well circumscribed intraconal lesion with mild to moderate enhancement. There may be areas of thrombosis. Ultrasonography: Ultrasonography shows well defined, round intraconal lesion with high internal reflectivity. Differential Diagnosis Lymphangioma. Neurofibroma. Schwannoma. Fibrous histiocytoma. Melanoma. Solitary fibrous tumour.

{"id":1682,"text":"#Treatment - Orbital Cavernous Haemangioma - LD23\nConservative therapy Small, asymptomatic orbital Cavernous haemangioma may be observed periodically for any growth and increase in size. Surgical therapy Surgical therapy may be required for larger and symptomatic tumours. Complete and meticulous excision is necessary to avoid recurrence. Conjunctival or cutaneous approach: Conjunctival or cutaneous approach may be used for removal of anterior lesions. Lateral orbitotomy: Lateral orbitotomy may be required to remove deep tumours. Sometimes, it is done along with osteotomy. Trans-cranial approach: Trans-cranial approach may be used for lesions localised at the orbital apex. Prognosis The management of orbital Cavernous haemangioma is not satisfactory. The proptosis is relieved only to a limited extent by irradiation. Surgical removal of this vascular tumour by orbitotomy may not be fully successful because of the extent of lesion. Surgical procedures or even ligation of feeding vessel to tumour, do carry the risk of damage to orbital structures e.g. damage to extra-ocular muscles resulting in ophthalmoplegia.","entities":[{"id":22581,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":91,"end_offset":120},{"id":22583,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":204,"end_offset":220},{"id":22588,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":340,"end_offset":374},{"id":22589,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":376,"end_offset":410},{"id":22591,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":476,"end_offset":494},{"id":22592,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":526,"end_offset":533},{"id":22593,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":579,"end_offset":601},{"id":22595,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":642,"end_offset":649},{"id":22596,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":667,"end_offset":679},{"id":22598,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":709,"end_offset":738},{"id":22599,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":852,"end_offset":867},{"id":22601,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":871,"end_offset":881},{"id":22603,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":935,"end_offset":941},{"id":22604,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":943,"end_offset":962},{"id":22605,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1108,"end_offset":1123},{"id":22606,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1064,"end_offset":1094},{"id":22579,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":42},{"id":22580,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":50,"end_offset":70},{"id":22582,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":187,"end_offset":203},{"id":22584,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":264,"end_offset":271},{"id":22587,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":438,"end_offset":454},{"id":22590,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":456,"end_offset":474},{"id":22594,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":603,"end_offset":625},{"id":22597,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":681,"end_offset":690},{"id":22600,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":827,"end_offset":843},{"id":22607,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1001,"end_offset":1007}],"relations":[{"id":11387,"from_id":22580,"to_id":22579,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11388,"from_id":22582,"to_id":22579,"type":"surgery_for_R"},{"id":11390,"from_id":22588,"to_id":22579,"type":"surgery_for_R"},{"id":11393,"from_id":22594,"to_id":22596,"type":"surgery_on_R"},{"id":11394,"from_id":22597,"to_id":22598,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11391,"from_id":22590,"to_id":22579,"type":"surgery_for_R"},{"id":11392,"from_id":22593,"to_id":22579,"type":"surgery_for_R"},{"id":11395,"from_id":22601,"to_id":22579,"type":"surgery_for_R"},{"id":11396,"from_id":22605,"to_id":22606,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

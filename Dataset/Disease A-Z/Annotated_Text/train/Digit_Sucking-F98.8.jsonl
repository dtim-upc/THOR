{"id":1205,"text":"#Overview - Digit Sucking - F98.8\nOne of the commonest oral habits is sucking, a reflex present at birth. Developing an oral habit is considered a natural phenomenon in children upto a certain age. It is a sign of natural growth and development of a child which stops without any intervention.

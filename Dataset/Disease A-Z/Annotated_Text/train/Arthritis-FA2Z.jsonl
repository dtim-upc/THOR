{"id":296,"text":"#Treatment - Arthritis - FA2Z\nPhysical exercise: During pain, exercise seems to be the last option but  muscle strengthening and stretching exercises have proved to be very helpful. To relieve pain: Pain relievers like NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs). NSAIDs generally interfere with chemicals called prostaglandins in the body, which trigger pain, inflammation, and fever. They are very helpful in relieving pain in all forms of arthritis. Surgery: Joint replacement surgery is often performed for those who are not able to walk or have lot of difficulty in walking. Disease-modifying anti rheumatic drugs (DMARDs): Often used to treat rheumatoid arthritis; DMARDs slow or stop immune system that attack joints. Examples include methotrexate (Trexall) and hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil). Intra-articular injection: It is a procedure used in the treatment of inflammatory joint conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, tendinitis, bursitis and occasionally osteoarthritis. A hypodermic needle is injected into the affected joint where it delivers a dose of any one of many anti-inflammatory agents, the most common of which are corticosteroids.","entities":[{"id":5492,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":22},{"id":5503,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":30,"end_offset":47},{"id":5506,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":104,"end_offset":124},{"id":5507,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":129,"end_offset":149},{"id":5509,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":219,"end_offset":265},{"id":5511,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":267,"end_offset":273},{"id":5512,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":445,"end_offset":454},{"id":5513,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":465,"end_offset":489},{"id":5514,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":583,"end_offset":630},{"id":5515,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":652,"end_offset":672},{"id":5516,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":674,"end_offset":680},{"id":5517,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":720,"end_offset":726},{"id":5518,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":745,"end_offset":757},{"id":5519,"label":"Composition_E","start_offset":759,"end_offset":766},{"id":5520,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":772,"end_offset":790},{"id":5522,"label":"Composition_E","start_offset":792,"end_offset":801},{"id":5523,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":804,"end_offset":829},{"id":5524,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":874,"end_offset":903},{"id":5525,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":913,"end_offset":933},{"id":5528,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":935,"end_offset":954},{"id":5532,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":962,"end_offset":972},{"id":5534,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":974,"end_offset":982},{"id":5535,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1000,"end_offset":1014},{"id":5531,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":956,"end_offset":960},{"id":5538,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1066,"end_offset":1071},{"id":5541,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1116,"end_offset":1140},{"id":5544,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1171,"end_offset":1186},{"id":5556,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":338,"end_offset":342},{"id":5557,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":358,"end_offset":362},{"id":5558,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":364,"end_offset":376},{"id":5559,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":382,"end_offset":387}],"relations":[{"id":2211,"from_id":5503,"to_id":5492,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2212,"from_id":5506,"to_id":5492,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2213,"from_id":5507,"to_id":5492,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":2214,"from_id":5509,"to_id":5492,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2221,"from_id":5513,"to_id":5492,"type":"surgery_for_R"},{"id":2223,"from_id":5514,"to_id":5515,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2225,"from_id":5518,"to_id":5519,"type":"made_with_R"},{"id":2230,"from_id":5520,"to_id":5522,"type":"made_with_R"},{"id":2231,"from_id":5518,"to_id":5492,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2232,"from_id":5520,"to_id":5492,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2234,"from_id":5523,"to_id":5525,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2236,"from_id":5523,"to_id":5528,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2237,"from_id":5525,"to_id":5524,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":2238,"from_id":5528,"to_id":5524,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

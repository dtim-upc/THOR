{"id":1978,"text":"#Causes - Puerperal Sepsis - JB40.0\nPuerperal sepsis is bacterial infection of the genital tract which occurs after the birth of a baby. Some of the most common bacteria causing puerperal sepsis are streptococci, staphylococci, escherichia coli (E.coli), clostridium tetani, clostridium welchii, chlamydia and gonococci (bacteria which cause sexually transmitted diseases). More than one type of bacteria may be involved in puerperal sepsis. Bacteria may be either nosocomial, endogenous or exogenous. Nosocomial infections are acquired in hospitals or other health facilities and may come from the hospital environment or from the patient's own flora. Endogenous bacteria- These bacteria are normally present in the vagina and rectum without causing any disease (e.g. some types of streptococci and staphylococci, E.coli, clostridium welchii). Exogenous bacteria-These bacteria are introduced into the vagina from the outside by unclean hands and unsterile instruments, sexually transmitted infections, foreign substances inserted in to vagina.","entities":[{"id":25572,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":26},{"id":25573,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":36,"end_offset":52},{"id":25574,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":56,"end_offset":96},{"id":25575,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":161,"end_offset":170},{"id":25576,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":178,"end_offset":194},{"id":25577,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":199,"end_offset":211},{"id":25578,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":213,"end_offset":226},{"id":25579,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":228,"end_offset":253},{"id":25580,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":255,"end_offset":273},{"id":25581,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":275,"end_offset":294},{"id":25582,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":296,"end_offset":306},{"id":25583,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":310,"end_offset":320},{"id":25584,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":424,"end_offset":440},{"id":25586,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":502,"end_offset":523},{"id":25587,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":653,"end_offset":672},{"id":25588,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":717,"end_offset":724},{"id":25589,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":845,"end_offset":863}],"relations":[{"id":13071,"from_id":25573,"to_id":25574,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":13072,"from_id":25576,"to_id":25575,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13073,"from_id":25576,"to_id":25577,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13074,"from_id":25576,"to_id":25578,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13075,"from_id":25576,"to_id":25579,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13076,"from_id":25576,"to_id":25579,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13077,"from_id":25576,"to_id":25580,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13078,"from_id":25576,"to_id":25581,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13079,"from_id":25576,"to_id":25582,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13080,"from_id":25576,"to_id":25583,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13081,"from_id":25572,"to_id":25587,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13082,"from_id":25572,"to_id":25589,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

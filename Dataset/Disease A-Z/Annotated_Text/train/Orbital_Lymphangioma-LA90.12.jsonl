Lymphangioma is a benign vascular hamartoma commonly noticed in head and neck area. Lymphangioma is a common vascular tumour in children and commonly presents in age group less than ten years. Like haemangiomas, Lymphangiomas may present in both superficial and deep orbital spaces. It consists of dilated, thin walled vascular chambers lined with endothelium.

Imaging studies: Ultrasonography: Ultrasonography lacks specificity and soft tissue details. It identifies soft tissue and cystic components of the lesion. Computed tomography: Computed tomography best delineates bony deformity produced by long-standing lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging: Magnetic resonance imaging provides superior quality soft tissue details.

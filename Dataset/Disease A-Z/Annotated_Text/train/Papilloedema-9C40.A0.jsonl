{"id":1710,"text":"#Symptoms - Papilloedema - 9C40.A0\nPapilloedema may be asymptomatic and is found on routine examination of the eyes. Most symptoms in papilloedema are due to rise in intracranial pressure. The main systemic features of raised intracranial pressure are: Headache which is characteristically most severe on awakening in the morning. It may be generalised or localised and may intensify with coughing, head movement , bending or with Valsalva manoeuvre ( forced expiration against closed mouth and nostrils). Pattern of headache may change in patients with previous chronic headache. Rarely, headache may be absent in patients with raised intracranial pressure. Nausea and projectile vomiting may be precipitated by fluctuations in intracranial pressure. Pulsatile tinnitus is ringing in the ear associated with pulse. Horizontal diplopia may be a false localising sign due to stretching of sixth intracranial nerve caused by raised intracranial pressure. Visual symptoms are usually absent but patient may have blurring of vision, constriction of visual fields and decreased colour perception. Visual acuity may be well preserved except in advanced cases.","entities":[{"id":22895,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":158,"end_offset":187},{"id":22898,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":253,"end_offset":329},{"id":22899,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":341,"end_offset":504},{"id":22902,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":659,"end_offset":750},{"id":22905,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1009,"end_offset":1027},{"id":22890,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":24},{"id":22891,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":35,"end_offset":47},{"id":22892,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":111,"end_offset":115},{"id":22894,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":134,"end_offset":146},{"id":22900,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":506,"end_offset":579},{"id":22901,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":589,"end_offset":657},{"id":22903,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":752,"end_offset":814},{"id":22904,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":816,"end_offset":951},{"id":22906,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1029,"end_offset":1090}],"relations":[{"id":11567,"from_id":22890,"to_id":22898,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":11572,"from_id":22890,"to_id":22903,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":11577,"from_id":22890,"to_id":22905,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":11560,"from_id":22894,"to_id":22895,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":11568,"from_id":22890,"to_id":22899,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":11569,"from_id":22890,"to_id":22900,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":11570,"from_id":22890,"to_id":22901,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":11571,"from_id":22890,"to_id":22902,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":11573,"from_id":22890,"to_id":22904,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":11578,"from_id":22890,"to_id":22906,"type":"has_symptom_R"}],"Comments":[]}

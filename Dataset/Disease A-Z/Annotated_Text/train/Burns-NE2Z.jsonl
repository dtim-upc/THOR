{"id":551,"text":"#Causes - Burns - NE2Z\nCommon causes of burns may be classified as thermal or inhalational. Heat burns occur by: Hot liquids (scalds) - Scalds are commonly caused by hot liquids (water, oil), steam from boiling water or heated food. Young children are mostly affected by scalds. Hot solids (Contact burns): Solid objects that are hot can cause contact burns, especially in children. Flames: Burns can be due to leaking gas pipe or cylinder, accidents from kerosene pressure stove, lighting of crackers during “Diwali”, catching of fires in tents as pandal fires. Chemical burns: These are accidental burns in homes (such as from toilet cleaning agents), or as acid violence attacks (throwing of acid over somebody for seeking revenge and attempts to resolve disputes of love, land or business) and work place accidents. Electrical burns: Electrical burns are due to exposed “live” wires or short circuits. High tension wires close to homes, play areas and roads can lead to electrical burns. Inhalational burns: Inhalational burns are the result of breathing in superheated gases, steam, hot liquids or noxious products of incomplete combustion. Inhalational burns are the most common cause of death among people suffering fire-related burn.","entities":[{"id":9240,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":16},{"id":9244,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":40,"end_offset":46},{"id":9251,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":92,"end_offset":102},{"id":9252,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":113,"end_offset":133},{"id":9258,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":166,"end_offset":190},{"id":9260,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":192,"end_offset":231},{"id":9263,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":271,"end_offset":277},{"id":9265,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":279,"end_offset":305},{"id":9269,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":344,"end_offset":357},{"id":9274,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":411,"end_offset":561},{"id":9267,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":307,"end_offset":333},{"id":9271,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":383,"end_offset":389},{"id":9272,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":391,"end_offset":397},{"id":9278,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":589,"end_offset":605},{"id":9276,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":563,"end_offset":577},{"id":9280,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":660,"end_offset":681},{"id":9288,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":866,"end_offset":904},{"id":9297,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1049,"end_offset":1144},{"id":9290,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":992,"end_offset":1010},{"id":9281,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":798,"end_offset":818},{"id":9283,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":820,"end_offset":836}],"relations":[{"id":4203,"from_id":9240,"to_id":9258,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4206,"from_id":9240,"to_id":9267,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4208,"from_id":9278,"to_id":9276,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4209,"from_id":9272,"to_id":9274,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4210,"from_id":9278,"to_id":9280,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4212,"from_id":9240,"to_id":9281,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4204,"from_id":9240,"to_id":9260,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4205,"from_id":9240,"to_id":9265,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4207,"from_id":9272,"to_id":9271,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4213,"from_id":9240,"to_id":9283,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4215,"from_id":9240,"to_id":9288,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4216,"from_id":9240,"to_id":9290,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4218,"from_id":9240,"to_id":9297,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4185,"from_id":9251,"to_id":9252,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":553,"text":"#Overview - Burns - NE2Z\nBurns are a serious public health problem. A burn is defined as an injury to the skin or other organic tissue primarily caused by heat or due to radiation, radioactivity, electricity, friction or contact with chemicals. Heat burns occur when some or all of the different layers of cells in the skin are destroyed by a hot liquid (scald), a hot solid (contact burn) or a flame (flame burn). Skin injuries due to ultraviolet radiation, radioactivity, electricity or chemicals, as well as respiratory damage resulting from smoke inhalation, are also considered as burns. Burns are also a leading cause of morbidity; millions who survive suffer from lifelong disability and disfigurements with resulting emotional trauma and stigma. Burns are preventable. Increased efforts in prevention and care would lead to significant reduction in burn-related morbidity, mortality and disability.","entities":[{"id":9384,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":18},{"id":9388,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":155,"end_offset":243},{"id":9390,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":267,"end_offset":413},{"id":9391,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":415,"end_offset":428},{"id":9385,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":25,"end_offset":31},{"id":9386,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":70,"end_offset":75},{"id":9387,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":92,"end_offset":134},{"id":9389,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":245,"end_offset":255},{"id":9392,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":436,"end_offset":561},{"id":9393,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":586,"end_offset":591},{"id":9394,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":593,"end_offset":599},{"id":9395,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":627,"end_offset":636},{"id":9396,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":754,"end_offset":760},{"id":9397,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":725,"end_offset":752}],"relations":[{"id":4245,"from_id":9386,"to_id":9387,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":4246,"from_id":9386,"to_id":9388,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4249,"from_id":9394,"to_id":9395,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":4247,"from_id":9389,"to_id":9390,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4248,"from_id":9393,"to_id":9392,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

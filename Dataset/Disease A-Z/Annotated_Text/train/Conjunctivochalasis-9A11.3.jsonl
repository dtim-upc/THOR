{"id":615,"text":"#Diagnosis - Conjunctivochalasis - 9A11.3\nCCh is one of the most common under diagnosed and misdiagnosed ocular surface disease. Non-specific symptoms along with intermittent findings of conjunctival oedema often lead to misdiagnosis. Due to fluctuation in findings of disease process, several clinical exams may be required to confirm the diagnosis. Diagnosis of CCh is mainly clinical. Slit lamp biomicroscopy (by an eye specialist) shows prolapsed or folds of conjunctiva in temporal, nasal or central part of lower lid-margin. Presence of redundant conjunctiva over lower lid margin suggests CCh. Prolapsed conjunctiva causes a disruption of tear movement and outflow through inferior lacrimal punctum resulting in epiphora.","entities":[{"id":10068,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":32},{"id":10078,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":105,"end_offset":127},{"id":10069,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":42,"end_offset":45},{"id":10079,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":187,"end_offset":206},{"id":10083,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":351,"end_offset":360},{"id":10085,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":364,"end_offset":367},{"id":10087,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":388,"end_offset":411},{"id":10091,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":463,"end_offset":474},{"id":10092,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":478,"end_offset":486},{"id":10094,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":488,"end_offset":529},{"id":10099,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":543,"end_offset":564},{"id":10104,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":632,"end_offset":659},{"id":10105,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":719,"end_offset":727},{"id":10081,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":340,"end_offset":349},{"id":10100,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":596,"end_offset":599},{"id":10102,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":601,"end_offset":622},{"id":10107,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":680,"end_offset":705}],"relations":[{"id":4638,"from_id":10085,"to_id":10083,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4640,"from_id":10087,"to_id":10092,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":4642,"from_id":10100,"to_id":10099,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":4645,"from_id":10068,"to_id":10087,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4639,"from_id":10087,"to_id":10091,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":4641,"from_id":10087,"to_id":10094,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":4644,"from_id":10105,"to_id":10107,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":4646,"from_id":10068,"to_id":10081,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":617,"text":"#Overview - Conjunctivochalasis - 9A11.3\nConjunctivochalasis (CCh) is defined as the presence of redundant non-oedematous conjunctiva that may be asymptomatic, or it may be symptomatic due to unstable tear film or mechanical disruption of tear flow. Conjunctivochalasis is usually found in older people and is often overlooked, and is classified as a normal variant of eye due to ageing. However, it has been seen in patients as early as first decade of life with an increase in prevalence and severity with age. It is usually bilateral condition and consists of an elevation of the bulbar conjunctiva over the lower lid margin, most commonly in the infero-temporal region. However, in addition to temporal region, it may involve bulbar conjunctiva along nasal, central lid-margin or any combination of these areas. The presence of loose redundant tissue causes disruption of inferior tear meniscus. This conjunctival prolapse may impede tear outflow through the inferior punctum, resulting in epiphora (watering from eyes).  It may also involve upper bulbar area with loose conjunctiva, but it is less common.","entities":[{"id":10117,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":41,"end_offset":66},{"id":10116,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":31},{"id":10119,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":107,"end_offset":133},{"id":10120,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":192,"end_offset":210},{"id":10121,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":214,"end_offset":248},{"id":10122,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":250,"end_offset":269},{"id":10125,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":369,"end_offset":372},{"id":10129,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":583,"end_offset":601},{"id":10131,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":730,"end_offset":748},{"id":10134,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":862,"end_offset":898},{"id":10140,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":994,"end_offset":1002},{"id":10141,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1046,"end_offset":1063},{"id":10128,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":527,"end_offset":546},{"id":10133,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":832,"end_offset":854},{"id":10135,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":905,"end_offset":926},{"id":10139,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":963,"end_offset":979},{"id":10142,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1069,"end_offset":1086}],"relations":[{"id":4653,"from_id":10117,"to_id":10119,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":4655,"from_id":10117,"to_id":10121,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":4654,"from_id":10117,"to_id":10120,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":4656,"from_id":10122,"to_id":10125,"type":"affects_R"}],"Comments":[]}

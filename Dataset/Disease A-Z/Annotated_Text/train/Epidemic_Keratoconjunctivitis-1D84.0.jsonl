{"id":912,"text":"#Causes - Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis - 1D84.0\nEKC is caused by adenoviruses and more than 50 serotypes have been isolated. There are at-least 19 documented serotypes which causes EKC. Most commonly associated serotypes include adenovirus 8, 19 and 37. Less commonly, EKC may be caused by serotypes 2 to 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16, 21 and 29. Because of prevalence of low natural immunity against adenovirus being present in general population, every individual is considered to be susceptible to infection. EKC is more common in adults, but it can infect all age groups. Adenovirus can be recovered from eye and throat even up to 14 days, after the onset of clinical symptoms. EKC epidemics usually take place in closed institutions like schools, camps, nursing homes, hospitals or places of work. Possible modes of transmission are: Direct contact with eye secretions: Direct contact with eye secretions is a major mode of transmission. Spread by air droplets.

Ipsilateral pre-auricular lymphadenopathy is one of the classic features of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. Decreased visual acuity is rarely present except in cases with corneal involvement. Laboratory diagnosis: Following tests may be used for diagnosis of EKC: Polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR assay): Fluorescent antibody test: Complement fixation test: Giemsa cytology: Giemsa cytology is microscopic examination of stained conjunctival scrapings for intranuclear inclusions and lymphocytes. Cell culture: Enzyme immune assays: AdenoPlus test: AdenoPlus test, an enhanced device for Rapid Pathogen Screening (RPS), is an antigen-based immunoassay. This test detects the presence of adenoviral particles and thus allows patient a speedier return to school or work when the virus is no longer detectable.

Objects that come into contact with eyes, such as cosmetics, should not be shared. A person may be contagious for two weeks or more after onset of symptoms, and therefore, should avoid return to work or school. Preventive measures include: Patients should not touch others and not to share tissues, towels, pillows or handkerchiefs and should wash hands frequently as long as the eye is red. Eye care professionals should wash their hands thoroughly after examining any patient. As a routine, they should wash their hands before seeing all patients. Health care workers caring for immune-compromised individuals are precluded from patient contact for up to two weeks to avoid transmission of infection. Ophthalmic instruments should be properly cleaned and sterilised. A ‘red eye room’ may be created to separate out red eye patients from other patients. Patient and their family members should be educated about the features of the disease. Patient should be informed that the symptoms may worsen during first 4-7 days after onset before they begin to improve, and they may not resolve for 2-3 weeks.","entities":[{"id":13835,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":14,"end_offset":43},{"id":13836,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":53,"end_offset":82},{"id":13837,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":284,"end_offset":291},{"id":13838,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":402,"end_offset":411},{"id":13839,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":592,"end_offset":683},{"id":13840,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":688,"end_offset":742},{"id":13842,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":744,"end_offset":829},{"id":13843,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":845,"end_offset":900},{"id":13844,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1055,"end_offset":1119},{"id":13846,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1121,"end_offset":1205},{"id":13847,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1207,"end_offset":1292}],"relations":[{"id":6617,"from_id":13835,"to_id":13839,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":6618,"from_id":13835,"to_id":13840,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":6619,"from_id":13835,"to_id":13842,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":6620,"from_id":13835,"to_id":13843,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":6621,"from_id":13835,"to_id":13844,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":6622,"from_id":13835,"to_id":13846,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":6623,"from_id":13835,"to_id":13847,"type":"has_precaution_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":918,"text":"#Treatment - Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis - 1D84.0\nManagement should be carried out under medical supervision. EKC is usually a self-limiting disease and it tends to resolve spontaneously within 1-3 weeks without leaving any significant complications. There is no effective treatment for EKC. Depending upon the severity of signs and symptoms, patients are followed up for several days to weeks. Goals of pharmacotherapy (treatment with medicines) are to reduce morbidity and to prevent any complications. Supportive medical management of EKC includes: -       Cold compresses. Artificial tears: Artificial tears stabilise and thicken pre-corneal tear film and prolong tear film break-up time (BUT), which occurs with dry eye. Topical vasoconstrictor\/antihistamine: Topical vasoconstrictor\/antihistamine may be used for severe itching. On discontinuation, it may cause rebound (recurrence) of symptoms. Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs): Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) may be used to reduce inflammation. Topical antibiotic: Topical antibiotic may be used to prevent superadded bacterial infection. Cycloplegic agents: Cycloplegic agents may be used for severe photophobia. Mild topical corticosteroids: Mild topical corticosteroids may be used in severe membranous conjunctivitis or patients with marked reduction in vision due to late sub-epithelial opacities. While corticosteroids do assist in reducing inflammation, they do not have any significant impact on natural course of the disease. Taper this treatment slowly to avoid recurrence of corneal opacities. Any patient on topical corticosteroid should be observed for side effects such as glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure) and formation of cataract. Topical immune-suppressants (e.g.Tacrolimus ointment): Topical immune-suppressants can inhibit autoimmune inflammatory responses. Tacrolimus is a treatment option for sub-epithelial infiltrates in EKC. Tacrolimus suppresses cellular immunity. Ophthalmic antiseptics (e.g.Povidone-iodine): Ophthalmic antiseptics are broad-spectrum germicidal agents. Povidone-iodine has broad antibacterial and antiviral activity. Povidone iodine may be used to reduce the duration of disease. Surgical management: Surgery is extremely rare for EKC and is reserved for severe cases with cicatricial conjunctivitis or symblepharon. If surgery is necessary, it is mainly in the form of: Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK): Excimer laser photo-therapeutic keratectomy (PTK), along with low-dose mitomycin, may be used to remove sub-epithelial opacities. Membrane or pseudo-membrane removal: Membrane or pseudo-membrane may be peeled off gently and a topical corticosteroid may be prescribed.Fornix reconstruction. Entropion

{"id":1444,"text":"#Causes - Mouth Ulcers - DA01.15\nAphthous ulcers are idiopathic (exact cause is not clear) and multifactorial, but likely involves activation of the cell-mediated immune system. These factors may include: Local trauma due to badly fitting dentures, braces, rough fillings or a sharp tooth, cuts or burns while eating or drinking hard food or hot drinks Emotional or physiologic stress, hormonal states (menstruation or pregnancy) Food hypersensitivity (such as cinnamon, cheese, citrus, figs or pineapple), sensitivity to sodium lauryl sulfate and certain medications (NSAIDs, beta-blockers or nicorandil). Many cases are related to iron, folic acid, vitamin B6 or B12 deficiency. Family history, immunological, and microbial factors are important in the onset of recurrent aphthous ulcerations. Systemic illness such as malabsorption, enteropathy, coeliac disease\/inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis (e.g., Behcet’s syndrome), reactive arthritis (e.g., Reiter’s syndrome), and HIV\/AIDS. Aphthous stomatitis is more prevalent in non-smokers and smokers who quit smoking. Less common in individuals with good oral hygiene practices.","entities":[{"id":20115,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":22},{"id":20116,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":33,"end_offset":48},{"id":20119,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":257,"end_offset":288},{"id":20121,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":353,"end_offset":384},{"id":20124,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":430,"end_offset":505},{"id":20125,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":507,"end_offset":605},{"id":20126,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":607,"end_offset":679},{"id":20129,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":697,"end_offset":733},{"id":20130,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":774,"end_offset":794},{"id":20131,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":821,"end_offset":834},{"id":20134,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":865,"end_offset":891},{"id":20135,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":893,"end_offset":929},{"id":20136,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":931,"end_offset":975},{"id":20137,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":981,"end_offset":989},{"id":20117,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":205,"end_offset":247},{"id":20118,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":249,"end_offset":255},{"id":20120,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":290,"end_offset":352},{"id":20123,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":386,"end_offset":429},{"id":20127,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":681,"end_offset":695},{"id":20132,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":836,"end_offset":847},{"id":20133,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":849,"end_offset":864},{"id":20138,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":991,"end_offset":1010}],"relations":[{"id":9959,"from_id":20130,"to_id":20129,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9962,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20119,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9963,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20120,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9964,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20121,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9966,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20124,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9967,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20125,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9970,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20131,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9971,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20132,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9973,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20134,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9974,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20135,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9975,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20136,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9976,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20137,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9960,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20117,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9961,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20118,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9965,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20123,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9968,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20126,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9969,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20127,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9972,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20133,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9977,"from_id":20115,"to_id":20138,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

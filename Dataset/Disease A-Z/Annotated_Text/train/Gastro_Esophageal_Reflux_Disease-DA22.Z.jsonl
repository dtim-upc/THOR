{"id":1024,"text":"#Complications - Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease - DA22.Z\nEsophageal ulcers are one of the most common complications of GERD. The excess acid produced by gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) can damage the lining of esophagus (esophagitis) which can lead to the formation of ulcers. The ulcers can bleed, causing pain and making it difficult to swallow. Ulcers can usually be successfully treated by controlling the underlying causes of GERD.","entities":[{"id":14813,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":17,"end_offset":49},{"id":14815,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":121,"end_offset":125},{"id":14816,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":155,"end_offset":194},{"id":14817,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":220,"end_offset":243},{"id":14821,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":279,"end_offset":285},{"id":14822,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":441,"end_offset":445},{"id":14814,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":59,"end_offset":76},{"id":14820,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":287,"end_offset":356},{"id":14823,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":358,"end_offset":365}],"relations":[{"id":7128,"from_id":14815,"to_id":14814,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":7129,"from_id":14816,"to_id":14817,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":7130,"from_id":14813,"to_id":14820,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":7131,"from_id":14816,"to_id":14821,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1026,"text":"#Diagnosis - Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease - DA22.Z\nDiagnosis of GERD is uaually accompanied with an accurate symptomatic history. It can be diagnosed by procedures like Endoscopy, Barium swallow and Manometry. Endoscopy: It is a procedure in which fibre-optic tube is inserted into the stomach. To confirm a diagnosis of GERD, the endoscope is inserted into mouth and down into the throat. The procedure is usually done while the patient is awake, and may be given a sedative to relax. An endoscopy is used to check whether the surface of esophagus has been damaged by stomach acid. It can also rule out more serious conditions that can also cause heartburn, such as stomach cancer. Barium swallow: If there are symptoms of dysphagia then patient may be referred for a test known as barium swallow. The barium swallow test is one of the most effective ways of assessing the swallowing ability and finding exactly where the problems are occurring. The test can often identify blockages or problems with the muscles used during swallowing. Manometry: Manometry is used to assess how well lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is working by measuring pressure levels inside the sphincter muscle. During the test, patient will be asked to swallow some food and liquid to check the proper functioning of LES. NHP provides indicative information for better understanding of health. For any diagnosis and treatment purpose you should consult your physician.","entities":[{"id":14849,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":543,"end_offset":552},{"id":14851,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":652,"end_offset":661},{"id":14852,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":671,"end_offset":685},{"id":14853,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":687,"end_offset":701},{"id":14854,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":728,"end_offset":737},{"id":14856,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":807,"end_offset":826},{"id":14859,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1042,"end_offset":1051},{"id":14863,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1199,"end_offset":1207},{"id":14839,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":173,"end_offset":182},{"id":14840,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":134,"end_offset":136},{"id":14842,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":203,"end_offset":212},{"id":14844,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":225,"end_offset":227},{"id":14845,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":290,"end_offset":297},{"id":14846,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":325,"end_offset":329},{"id":14837,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":45},{"id":14838,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":67,"end_offset":72},{"id":14841,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":184,"end_offset":198},{"id":14843,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":214,"end_offset":223},{"id":14847,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":394,"end_offset":407},{"id":14848,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":493,"end_offset":502},{"id":14850,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":573,"end_offset":585},{"id":14855,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":787,"end_offset":801},{"id":14857,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":951,"end_offset":959},{"id":14858,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1010,"end_offset":1017},{"id":14860,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1053,"end_offset":1062},{"id":14861,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1090,"end_offset":1122},{"id":14864,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1298,"end_offset":1301}],"relations":[{"id":7141,"from_id":14857,"to_id":14858,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":7142,"from_id":14860,"to_id":14861,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":7137,"from_id":14840,"to_id":14839,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":7139,"from_id":14840,"to_id":14842,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":7140,"from_id":14844,"to_id":14845,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":7138,"from_id":14840,"to_id":14841,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

The esophagus is a long tube of muscle that runs from mouth to the stomach. Normally once the food is chewed, it goes from mouth to the esophagus and then into the stomach, where it is mixed with the acidic gastric juice for digestion. The esophagus and the stomach are separated by a sphincter (lower esophageal sphincter), which is a band of muscular fibers that close the valve in order to prevent the food or gastric acids from going back to the esophagus.","entities":[{"id":14865,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":44},{"id":14868,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":155,"end_offset":200},{"id":14870,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":256,"end_offset":261},{"id":14875,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":546,"end_offset":561},{"id":14876,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":652,"end_offset":661},{"id":14866,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":54,"end_offset":93},{"id":14867,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":118,"end_offset":132},{"id":14869,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":206,"end_offset":215},{"id":14871,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":269,"end_offset":276},{"id":14872,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":442,"end_offset":451},{"id":14873,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":460,"end_offset":467},{"id":14874,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":487,"end_offset":496}],"relations":[{"id":7144,"from_id":14866,"to_id":14868,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7143,"from_id":14866,"to_id":14867,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1294,"text":"#Causes - Nipah Virus Infection - 1D63\nNipah virus (NiV) infection is caused by a virus, that is named after the Malaysian village where it was first discovered. NiV is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus. Fruit bats of the genus Pteropus have been identified as natural reservoirs of NiV. Bats are symptomless carriers of NiV, but infected bats shed virus in their excretion and secretion such as saliva, urine, semen and excreta. The NiV is highly contagious among pigs and spreads by coughing. After direct contact with infected bats, infected pigs. Human to human transmission by direct contact from other NiV infected people. By consumption of raw date palm sap and fruits contaminated with infectious bat excretions.","entities":[{"id":18394,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":312,"end_offset":316},{"id":18395,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":345,"end_offset":348},{"id":18399,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":632,"end_offset":644},{"id":18400,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":575,"end_offset":620},{"id":18402,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":693,"end_offset":743},{"id":18387,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":39,"end_offset":66},{"id":18388,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":82,"end_offset":87},{"id":18389,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":162,"end_offset":165},{"id":18386,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":31},{"id":18390,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":192,"end_offset":207},{"id":18391,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":209,"end_offset":226},{"id":18392,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":228,"end_offset":260},{"id":18393,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":307,"end_offset":310},{"id":18396,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":354,"end_offset":367},{"id":18397,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":458,"end_offset":461},{"id":18398,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":465,"end_offset":493},{"id":18401,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":656,"end_offset":688}],"relations":[{"id":8972,"from_id":18395,"to_id":18396,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8975,"from_id":18386,"to_id":18401,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8976,"from_id":18386,"to_id":18402,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8969,"from_id":18387,"to_id":18388,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8970,"from_id":18393,"to_id":18392,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8971,"from_id":18395,"to_id":18394,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8973,"from_id":18397,"to_id":18398,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":8974,"from_id":18399,"to_id":18400,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1296,"text":"#Overview - Nipah Virus Infection - 1D63\nNipah virus (NiV) infection is a new emerging zoonotic disease (transmissible from animals to humans) affecting both animals (pigs and other domestic animals) and humans. Fruit bats of the Pteropodidae Family, Pteropus genus are the natural host for the virus. NiV was first identified in Malaysia in 1998, during an outbreak of disease that occurred in a place called Kampung Sungai Nipah. Pigs were the intermediate hosts in this outbreak and most of the human cases resulted from exposure to ill pigs. After that in Singapore during March 1999 eleven abattoir workers developed NiV infection following close contact with imported pigs from Malaysia. Outbreak of Nipah virus infection was reported in Bangladesh in 2001. Since then, outbreaks of Nipah virus encephalitis have been reported almost every year in selected districts of Bangladesh. Consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated by flying bats was the primary source of human NiV infection in Bangladesh. In India outbreaks of NiV infection were reported from Siliguri (January-February 2001) and Nadia (April-2007) districts in West Bengal. Seventy one cases with 50 deaths (70% of the cases) occurred in two outbreaks. Recently in May 2018 an outbreak of NiV infection is reported from Kerala. Outbreaks reported from South-East Asia have a seasonal pattern with occurrence during winter and spring (December-May). This pattern could be associated with several factors like the breeding season of the bats, increased shedding of virus by the bats and the date palm sap harvesting season. Nipah cases may occur in a cluster or as an outbreak. There is strong evidence that loss of natural habitats of bats by human activity may attribute to emergence of bat-related viral infection communicable to humans and animals.","entities":[{"id":18418,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":302,"end_offset":305},{"id":18420,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":981,"end_offset":994},{"id":18421,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1032,"end_offset":1045},{"id":18415,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":33},{"id":18416,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":41,"end_offset":68},{"id":18417,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":87,"end_offset":142},{"id":18419,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":706,"end_offset":727}],"relations":[{"id":8980,"from_id":18416,"to_id":18417,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":547,"text":"#Overview - Coronary Heart Disease - BA5Z\nCoronary heart disease (CHD) is the thinning or blockage of the coronary arteries, usually caused by atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis (sometimes called “hardening” or “clogging” of the arteries) is the buildup of cholesterol and fatty deposits (called plaques) on the inner walls of the arteries. These deposits can restrict blood flow to the heart muscle by clogging the artery. This result in reduced supply of blood to the heart, thus heart becomes starved of oxygen and the vital nutrients it requires to work properly. This can lead to chest pain called angina. If blood supply to a portion of the heart muscle is cut off entirely, or if the energy demands of the heart become much greater than its blood supply, a heart attack (injury to the heart muscle) may occur. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death for both men and women living in urban areas as compared to rural India.","entities":[{"id":9270,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":106,"end_offset":123},{"id":9266,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":34},{"id":9268,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":42,"end_offset":70},{"id":9273,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":143,"end_offset":158},{"id":9275,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":160,"end_offset":175},{"id":9282,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":310,"end_offset":337},{"id":9285,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":358,"end_offset":377},{"id":9289,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":762,"end_offset":774},{"id":9284,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":385,"end_offset":397},{"id":9287,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":583,"end_offset":607},{"id":9291,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":815,"end_offset":843}],"relations":[{"id":4181,"from_id":9268,"to_id":9273,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4183,"from_id":9285,"to_id":9284,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":4180,"from_id":9268,"to_id":9270,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":4182,"from_id":9275,"to_id":9282,"type":"affects_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":548,"text":"#Symptoms - Coronary Heart Disease - BA5Z\nThe most common feature of CHD is chest pain (angina) and heart attack. Generally pain occurs when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The intensity of pain is varies from person to person. It may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing the heart. There may be an uneasy feeling under breast bone (sternum), but also in neck, arms, stomach, or upper back. The pain usually occurs with activity or in emotional state, and goes away with rest or a medicine called nitroglycerin. Other symptoms include shortness of breath and fatigue with activity (exertion). Women, elderly people, and people with diabetes are more likely to have symptoms other than chest pain, such as: Fatigue. Shortness of breath.

{"id":1438,"text":"#Causes - Mastitis - GB21.Z\nMilk stasis occurs when baby is not sucking properly, and milk is collected within the breast tissue of lactating woman, that may lead to non-infectious inflammation (or non-infectious mastitis). As the stagnant milk provides a suitable environment for the bacteria to grow (without effective removal of milk) non-infectious mastitis may progress to infectious mastitis, and further to formation of an abscess. Various reasons for milk stasis may be: Poor attachment of the infant at the breast; ineffective suckling; restriction of the frequency or duration of feeds; a blocked milk duct; an overabundant milk supply; lactating for twins or higher multiples. Cracked nipple: Fissured or painful nipples may lead to avoidance of feeding on the affected breast and thus predispose to milk stasis. The commonest cause of trauma is poor attachment at the breast. Bacteria from women’s skin or baby's mouth can enter the milk ducts through a crack in the skin of nipple or through a milk duct opening.","entities":[{"id":19968,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":52,"end_offset":80},{"id":19971,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":166,"end_offset":193},{"id":19973,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":227,"end_offset":301},{"id":19974,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":378,"end_offset":397},{"id":19976,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":479,"end_offset":522},{"id":19984,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":704,"end_offset":787},{"id":19985,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":811,"end_offset":822},{"id":19987,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":888,"end_offset":1024},{"id":19965,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":18},{"id":19969,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":86,"end_offset":147},{"id":19970,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":28,"end_offset":39},{"id":19972,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":198,"end_offset":221},{"id":19975,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":338,"end_offset":361},{"id":19977,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":524,"end_offset":544},{"id":19978,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":546,"end_offset":595},{"id":19979,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":597,"end_offset":616},{"id":19980,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":618,"end_offset":645},{"id":19981,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":647,"end_offset":686},{"id":19982,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":459,"end_offset":470},{"id":19983,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":688,"end_offset":702},{"id":19986,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":857,"end_offset":886}],"relations":[{"id":9865,"from_id":19971,"to_id":19968,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9868,"from_id":19972,"to_id":19969,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9869,"from_id":19975,"to_id":19973,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9872,"from_id":19982,"to_id":19976,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9874,"from_id":19982,"to_id":19978,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9875,"from_id":19982,"to_id":19979,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9876,"from_id":19982,"to_id":19980,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9880,"from_id":19965,"to_id":19986,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9866,"from_id":19971,"to_id":19969,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9867,"from_id":19972,"to_id":19968,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9870,"from_id":19974,"to_id":19973,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9873,"from_id":19982,"to_id":19977,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9877,"from_id":19982,"to_id":19981,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9878,"from_id":19985,"to_id":19984,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9879,"from_id":19985,"to_id":19983,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9881,"from_id":19965,"to_id":19987,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1442,"text":"#Prevention - Mastitis - GB21.Z\nSkilled help to promote\/support breastfeeding- Women and those who care for them (mother and child) should know about effective breastfeeding management as it is beneficial for both- to feed the infant adequately and to keep the breasts healthy. Breastfeeding should be managed appropriately from the beginning to throughout the first two years of life to prevent situations which give rise to milk stasis. Important points are: Mother should start to breastfeed within an hour of delivery; make sure that the infant is well attached to the breast, taking care to prevent irritation and cracking of the nipple; breastfeed with no restrictions, in either the frequency or duration of feeds, and let the baby finish the first breast first, before offering the other; exclusive breastfeeding up to six months of age (the infant only receives breast milk without any additional food or drink, not even water); encourage breastfeeding ‘on demand’ (as often as the child wants, day and night); no use of bottles, teats or pacifier. Mothers should be taught to hand-express when the breasts are too full for the infant to attach or the infant does not relieve breast fullness. A breast pump may also be used, if available, for these purposes. During the time of weaning, mother should wean the baby over several weeks instead of suddenly stopping breast feeding.","entities":[{"id":20017,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":14,"end_offset":22},{"id":20018,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":32,"end_offset":77},{"id":20019,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":215,"end_offset":276},{"id":20020,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":461,"end_offset":521},{"id":20022,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":581,"end_offset":641},{"id":20023,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":643,"end_offset":674},{"id":20024,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":679,"end_offset":720},{"id":20026,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":726,"end_offset":795},{"id":20028,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":938,"end_offset":1018},{"id":20030,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1058,"end_offset":1200},{"id":20031,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1202,"end_offset":1266},{"id":20021,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":523,"end_offset":579},{"id":20027,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":797,"end_offset":936},{"id":20029,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1020,"end_offset":1056},{"id":20032,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1268,"end_offset":1386}],"relations":[{"id":9896,"from_id":20017,"to_id":20018,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":9897,"from_id":20017,"to_id":20019,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":9902,"from_id":20017,"to_id":20024,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":9904,"from_id":20017,"to_id":20027,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":9906,"from_id":20017,"to_id":20029,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":9907,"from_id":20017,"to_id":20030,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":9908,"from_id":20017,"to_id":20031,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":9909,"from_id":20017,"to_id":20032,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":9898,"from_id":20017,"to_id":20020,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":9899,"from_id":20017,"to_id":20021,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":9900,"from_id":20017,"to_id":20022,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":9901,"from_id":20017,"to_id":20023,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":9903,"from_id":20017,"to_id":20026,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":9905,"from_id":20017,"to_id":20028,"type":"has_precaution_R"}],"Comments":[]}

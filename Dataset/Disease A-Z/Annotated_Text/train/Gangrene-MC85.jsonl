{"id":988,"text":"#Diagnosis - Gangrene - MC85\nClinical tests can be carried out to confirm the diagnosis of gangrene. These include: Blood tests: An increase or decrease in the number of white blood cells can indicate infection. Tissue culture: A small sample of fluid (or tissue) from the affected area can be tested for bacteria. This test is called a Gram stain. Blood culture: A sample of infected blood is removed and placed in a warm environment to encourage the growth of bacteria. Imaging tests: A range of imaging tests, such as X-rays, MRI scans (where radio waves are used to produce an image of the inside of your body) or a computerized tomography (CT) scan can be used to confirm the presence and spread of gangrene. Surgery: Surgical examination may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of gas gangrene.","entities":[{"id":14433,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":176,"end_offset":187},{"id":14435,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":256,"end_offset":262},{"id":14441,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":620,"end_offset":653},{"id":14444,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":723,"end_offset":743},{"id":14445,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":789,"end_offset":801},{"id":14434,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":212,"end_offset":226},{"id":14436,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":337,"end_offset":347},{"id":14437,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":349,"end_offset":362},{"id":14438,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":472,"end_offset":485},{"id":14439,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":521,"end_offset":527},{"id":14440,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":529,"end_offset":538},{"id":14442,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":704,"end_offset":712},{"id":14443,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":714,"end_offset":721},{"id":14429,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":21},{"id":14432,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":116,"end_offset":127},{"id":14430,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":29,"end_offset":43},{"id":14431,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":91,"end_offset":99}],"relations":[{"id":6913,"from_id":14431,"to_id":14430,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":6914,"from_id":14432,"to_id":14433,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":6916,"from_id":14434,"to_id":14435,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":6918,"from_id":14429,"to_id":14437,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":6920,"from_id":14442,"to_id":14440,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":6923,"from_id":14444,"to_id":14443,"type":"needs_R"},{"id":6915,"from_id":14429,"to_id":14432,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":6917,"from_id":14429,"to_id":14434,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":6919,"from_id":14442,"to_id":14441,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":6921,"from_id":14442,"to_id":14439,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":6922,"from_id":14445,"to_id":14444,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

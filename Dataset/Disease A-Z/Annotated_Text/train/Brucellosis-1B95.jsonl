{"id":456,"text":"#Causes - Brucellosis - 1B95\nBrucellosis is caused by different species of bacteria Brucella such as Brucella abortus,Brucella melitensis,  Brucella suis, Brucella canis. They are shed in large numbers in the urine, milk and placental fluid of infected animals. The infection is transmitted to humans by animals through three different ways: Infection may occur with direct contact with infected materials like afterbirth, blood, urine through broken skin, mucus membrane or conjunctiva. Infection may takes place indirectly by ingestion of animal products such as raw milk and cheese made from raw milk. It is the major source  of infection in humans. Infection may also spread by inhalation of airborne agents. Brucella spp. can survive for long periods in dust, dung, water, slurry, aborted fetuses, soil, meat and dairy products. Human-to-human transmission is very rare. Incubation period is highly variable. Usually 2-4 weeks, can be 1 week to 2 months or longer.","entities":[{"id":8212,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":22},{"id":8213,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":29,"end_offset":41},{"id":8219,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":457,"end_offset":486},{"id":8223,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":682,"end_offset":711},{"id":8214,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":75,"end_offset":169},{"id":8215,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":262,"end_offset":275},{"id":8216,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":342,"end_offset":421},{"id":8217,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":423,"end_offset":428},{"id":8218,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":430,"end_offset":455},{"id":8220,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":488,"end_offset":498},{"id":8221,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":605,"end_offset":608},{"id":8222,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":653,"end_offset":663}],"relations":[{"id":3646,"from_id":8213,"to_id":8214,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3647,"from_id":8212,"to_id":8216,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3648,"from_id":8212,"to_id":8217,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3649,"from_id":8212,"to_id":8218,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3650,"from_id":8212,"to_id":8219,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Eradication by testing and culling is the way to the elimination of brucellosis in regions with a low prevalence.

Brucellosis is a disease of mainly cattle, swine, goats, sheep and dogs. The infection is transmitted to humans by animals through direct contact with infected materials like afterbirth or indirectly by ingestion of animal products and by inhalation of airborne agents.

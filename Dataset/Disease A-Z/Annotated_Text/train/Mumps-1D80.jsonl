{"id":1229,"text":"#Overview - Mumps - 1D80\nMumps is a viral infection and most often a mild disease of childhood. It affects children between five and nine years of age. However, the mumps can affect both adolescents and adults. Mumps virus is present throughout the world. It spreads by airborne droplets released when an infected person sneezes or coughs and by direct contact with an infected person. In temperate climates the disease incidence is peak in winter and spring while in hot climates the disease may occur at any time of year. Many countries experience epidemics at intervals of 2–5 years. Humans are the only known host for mumps virus. It primarily affects the salivary glands and it is sometimes called infectious parotitis. In countries where large-scale immunization against mumps has been implemented, disease incidence has dropped dramatically. Before introduction of mumps vaccine, annual incidences were ranging from 100–1000 cases\/100000 population. In India outbreaks and sporadic cases are reported throughout the year and from all regions of the country. Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Government of India, has reported about 45 outbreaks of mumps from the different parts of the country in 2016. Passive reporting of mumps cases is also done by Indian academy of pediatrics (IAP) through its web based infectious disease surveillance system (IDSurv). Mumps is a vaccine-preventable disease. 121 countries or 62% countries of the world have included mumps vaccine in their routine schedule in the form of MMR vaccine.","entities":[{"id":17602,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":25,"end_offset":30},{"id":17603,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":36,"end_offset":51},{"id":17604,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":69,"end_offset":94},{"id":17605,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":96,"end_offset":98},{"id":17606,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":99,"end_offset":151},{"id":17608,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":211,"end_offset":222},{"id":17611,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":346,"end_offset":384},{"id":17612,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":270,"end_offset":338},{"id":17614,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1510,"end_offset":1523},{"id":17601,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":17},{"id":17607,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":161,"end_offset":170},{"id":17610,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":256,"end_offset":258},{"id":17613,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1565,"end_offset":1576}],"relations":[{"id":8550,"from_id":17602,"to_id":17604,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":8553,"from_id":17610,"to_id":17611,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8549,"from_id":17602,"to_id":17603,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":8551,"from_id":17605,"to_id":17606,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":8552,"from_id":17610,"to_id":17612,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

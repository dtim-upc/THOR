Water displacement method: The water displacement method is based on the principle that helps to calculate the volume of an object by measuring how much water it displaces. Perometry: Perometry is a technique that uses infrared light to measure the volume of limb. This process can accurately calculate how swollen affected limb is. Imaging tests: Imaging tests may also be used to help in the diagnosis. These include: A Lymphoscintigraph, A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scan, An Ultrasound Scan.","entities":[{"id":21971,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":25},{"id":21977,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":670,"end_offset":709},{"id":21972,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":90,"end_offset":102},{"id":21973,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":229,"end_offset":254},{"id":21974,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":402,"end_offset":411},{"id":21975,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":562,"end_offset":575},{"id":21976,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":649,"end_offset":668},{"id":21978,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":711,"end_offset":729}],"relations":[{"id":11067,"from_id":21971,"to_id":21972,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":11071,"from_id":21971,"to_id":21976,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":11073,"from_id":21971,"to_id":21978,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":11068,"from_id":21971,"to_id":21973,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":11069,"from_id":21971,"to_id":21974,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":11070,"from_id":21971,"to_id":21975,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":11072,"from_id":21971,"to_id":21977,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":379,"text":"#Causes - Antepartum hemorrhage - JA41.Z\nThe causes of APH include: placenta praevia, placental abruption and local causes (such as bleeding from the vulva, vagina or cervix). Abruption is more likely to be related to conditions occurring during pregnancy and placenta praevia is more likely to be related to conditions existing prior to pregnancy. Placenta praevia is defined as a placenta that lies wholly or partly within the lower uterine segment. It occurs in .4%-.8 % of pregnancies. The condition is mostly diagnosed on ultrasound examination. Factors associated with the development of placenta praevia include: increasing maternal parity, advancing maternal age, increasing placental size (multiple pregnancy), endometrial damage (previous dilatation and curettage), endometritis previous caesarean section, uterine scars and pathology, previous myomectomy, placental abnormalities, previous placental praevia, andcigarette smoking. Placental abruption\/ abruptio placentae –Placental abruption is the premature separation of a normally situated placenta from the uterine wall, resulting in haemorrhage before the delivery of the foetus. Placenta accrete- When the placenta (or part of the Placenta) invades and is inseparable from the uterine wall, it is called placenta accrete. It can cause bleeding during the third trimester and severe blood loss during delivery. Other causes-In a small proportion of cases cervicitis, trauma, vulval varicosities (varicose veins at the outer surface of the female genitalia -vulva), genital tumours, genital infections and vasa previa may be the cause of APH. Many of these conditions are evident on the initial speculum examination.","entities":[{"id":6861,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":176,"end_offset":185},{"id":6862,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":260,"end_offset":276},{"id":6863,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":349,"end_offset":365},{"id":6864,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":429,"end_offset":450},{"id":6865,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":527,"end_offset":549},{"id":6866,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":490,"end_offset":503},{"id":6869,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":672,"end_offset":718},{"id":6870,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":720,"end_offset":774},{"id":6872,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":817,"end_offset":844},{"id":6875,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":892,"end_offset":918},{"id":6876,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":920,"end_offset":940},{"id":6877,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":942,"end_offset":961},{"id":6879,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":983,"end_offset":1002},{"id":6880,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1054,"end_offset":1084},{"id":6883,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1244,"end_offset":1256},{"id":6885,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1271,"end_offset":1287},{"id":6886,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1395,"end_offset":1431},{"id":6890,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1548,"end_offset":1566},{"id":6858,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":31},{"id":6859,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":68,"end_offset":84},{"id":6867,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":620,"end_offset":646},{"id":6868,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":648,"end_offset":670},{"id":6871,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":776,"end_offset":815},{"id":6873,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":846,"end_offset":865},{"id":6874,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":867,"end_offset":890},{"id":6878,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":963,"end_offset":981},{"id":6881,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1138,"end_offset":1144},{"id":6882,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1146,"end_offset":1162},{"id":6884,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1173,"end_offset":1181},{"id":6887,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1433,"end_offset":1439},{"id":6888,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1441,"end_offset":1529},{"id":6889,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1531,"end_offset":1546},{"id":6891,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1571,"end_offset":1582},{"id":6892,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1603,"end_offset":1606},{"id":6860,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":86,"end_offset":174}],"relations":[{"id":2934,"from_id":6858,"to_id":6859,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2935,"from_id":6858,"to_id":6860,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2936,"from_id":6858,"to_id":6862,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2937,"from_id":6858,"to_id":6863,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2938,"from_id":6858,"to_id":6867,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2939,"from_id":6858,"to_id":6868,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2940,"from_id":6858,"to_id":6869,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2941,"from_id":6858,"to_id":6870,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2942,"from_id":6858,"to_id":6871,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2943,"from_id":6858,"to_id":6872,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2944,"from_id":6858,"to_id":6873,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2945,"from_id":6858,"to_id":6874,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2946,"from_id":6858,"to_id":6875,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2947,"from_id":6858,"to_id":6876,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2948,"from_id":6858,"to_id":6877,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2949,"from_id":6858,"to_id":6878,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2950,"from_id":6858,"to_id":6882,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2951,"from_id":6892,"to_id":6886,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2952,"from_id":6892,"to_id":6887,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2953,"from_id":6892,"to_id":6888,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2954,"from_id":6892,"to_id":6889,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2955,"from_id":6892,"to_id":6890,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2956,"from_id":6892,"to_id":6891,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

For the mother, APH can lead to: Anaemia, Infection, Maternal shock due to blood loss, Failure of the kidneys or other organs resulting from significant blood loss, Blood clotting problems (disseminated intravascular coagulation-DIC), Need for a blood transfusion, Postpartum haemorrhage, Pronged hospital stay, Psychological sequelae, Couvelaire uterus- This may occur after placental abruption. It is a phenomenon wherein the retroplacental blood may penetrate through the thickness of the wall of the uterus into the peritoneal cavity. Rarely, when uterine bleeding cannot be controlled, hysterectomy may be necessary.

Initially clinical assessment of women presenting with APH is done by medical person to establish urgency of intervention required to manage maternal or fetal compromise. If there is no maternal compromise a full history should be taken. It includes history taking to assess coexisting symptoms such as pain, an assessment of the extent of vaginal bleeding, the cardiovascular condition of the mother, and an assessment of fetal wellbeing. In placenta previa, uterus is felt to be relaxed on palpation and non-tender. Generally presenting part is high up and floating. In placental abruption, the triad of sudden onset of abdominal pain, bleeding per vagina, tense and tender uterus constitutes the main diagnostic criteria. Speculum examination- A speculum examination can be useful to identify cervical dilatation or can visualise a lower genital tract cause for the APH. Blood tests- Full blood count with haemoglobin estimation, Blood grouping with Rh factor, Screening for coagulation factor, Liver function tests, Urea and electrolyte test. Ultrasound scan (USG)- Women presenting with APH should have an ultrasound scan performed to confirm or exclude placenta praevia, if the placental site is not already known.

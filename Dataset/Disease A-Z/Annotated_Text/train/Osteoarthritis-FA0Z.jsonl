Primary prevention of OA includes: Weight control: Obesity is a risk factor for OA, thus maintaining or reducing weight through altered diet and increased physical exercise can lower the risk of developing OA. Exercise- Regular physical activity according to individual’s health status and lifestyle can keep the muscles around the joints strong and decreases the bone loss. Exercise needs to be directed for the entire body and not just the joints that are affected by OA. Both aerobic and muscle strengthening activities are recommended for people with arthritis. Exercise programme can be planned with the consultation of doctor. Occupational injury prevention: Repetitive use of joint should be avoided and proper management of related injuries can help prevent arthritis. Sports injury prevention: Taking the necessary precautions to prevent injury such as warming up and using proper equipment can help reduce joint injuries. Misalignment: Improper alignment of the knee or hip can contribute to osteoarthritis and proper treatment such as orthotics or bracing can help reduce the risk of developing the disease.","entities":[{"id":22257,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":257,"end_offset":259},{"id":22258,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":270,"end_offset":284},{"id":22260,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":315,"end_offset":317},{"id":22261,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":441,"end_offset":443},{"id":22264,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":324,"end_offset":407},{"id":22265,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":567,"end_offset":573},{"id":22255,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":14,"end_offset":28},{"id":22256,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":103,"end_offset":117},{"id":22259,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":286,"end_offset":293},{"id":22262,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":445,"end_offset":453},{"id":22263,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":455,"end_offset":534},{"id":22266,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":599,"end_offset":608},{"id":22267,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":655,"end_offset":659},{"id":22268,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":705,"end_offset":707},{"id":22269,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":610,"end_offset":618},{"id":22270,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":677,"end_offset":683},{"id":22272,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":790,"end_offset":799},{"id":22273,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":868,"end_offset":898},{"id":22274,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":900,"end_offset":983},{"id":22275,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1001,"end_offset":1010},{"id":22276,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1012,"end_offset":1036},{"id":22277,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1167,"end_offset":1179},{"id":22271,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":714,"end_offset":757},{"id":22278,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1237,"end_offset":1251},{"id":22280,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1281,"end_offset":1290},{"id":22279,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1181,"end_offset":1218},{"id":22281,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1294,"end_offset":1301},{"id":22282,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1341,"end_offset":1352}],"relations":[{"id":11237,"from_id":22257,"to_id":22258,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":11241,"from_id":22268,"to_id":22270,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":11242,"from_id":22268,"to_id":22267,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":11243,"from_id":22268,"to_id":22269,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":11244,"from_id":22272,"to_id":22271,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":11246,"from_id":22275,"to_id":22273,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":11247,"from_id":22255,"to_id":22276,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":11250,"from_id":22281,"to_id":22278,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11251,"from_id":22255,"to_id":22277,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":11238,"from_id":22260,"to_id":22259,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11239,"from_id":22260,"to_id":22264,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":11240,"from_id":22255,"to_id":22263,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":11245,"from_id":22275,"to_id":22274,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":11248,"from_id":22278,"to_id":22279,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11249,"from_id":22280,"to_id":22278,"type":"prescribed_for_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Certain occupations such as farming, construction work and physical education teaching are risk factors for the development of OA. iv) Exercise- High impact sports present an increased risk for OA. v) Genetics- There is genetic susceptibility to the disease; children of parents with early onset OA are at a higher risk of developing OA. vi) Obesity- It is a strongest modifiable risk factor, being overweight at an average age of 36-37 years is a risk factor for developing knee OA. vii) Gender and ethnicity- Women are more likely to develop OA than men, especially after age 50. OA is more common in Europeans than in Asians. viii) Bone density- Decreased bone mineral density is a risk factor for OA.","entities":[{"id":22313,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":964,"end_offset":966},{"id":22314,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":973,"end_offset":993},{"id":22315,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":995,"end_offset":1000},{"id":22316,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1028,"end_offset":1030},{"id":22319,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1087,"end_offset":1096},{"id":22321,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1119,"end_offset":1131},{"id":22322,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1133,"end_offset":1163},{"id":22317,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1052,"end_offset":1064},{"id":22318,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1066,"end_offset":1068},{"id":22323,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1185,"end_offset":1187},{"id":22284,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":103,"end_offset":106},{"id":22285,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":84,"end_offset":98},{"id":22287,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":148,"end_offset":150},{"id":22289,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":241,"end_offset":247},{"id":22292,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":299,"end_offset":314},{"id":22293,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":342,"end_offset":344},{"id":22296,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":390,"end_offset":420},{"id":22297,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":422,"end_offset":443},{"id":22298,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":447,"end_offset":482},{"id":22300,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":521,"end_offset":538},{"id":22302,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":611,"end_offset":613},{"id":22304,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":629,"end_offset":647},{"id":22305,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":678,"end_offset":680},{"id":22306,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":685,"end_offset":693},{"id":22307,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":730,"end_offset":741},{"id":22309,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":818,"end_offset":820},{"id":22311,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":826,"end_offset":833},{"id":22283,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":15,"end_offset":29},{"id":22288,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":108,"end_offset":131},{"id":22290,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":249,"end_offset":278},{"id":22291,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":280,"end_offset":294},{"id":22294,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":351,"end_offset":361},{"id":22295,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":363,"end_offset":365},{"id":22299,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":512,"end_offset":519},{"id":22301,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":543,"end_offset":570},{"id":22303,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":619,"end_offset":627},{"id":22310,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":755,"end_offset":782},{"id":22312,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":877,"end_offset":926}],"relations":[{"id":11269,"from_id":22313,"to_id":22312,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11270,"from_id":22316,"to_id":22314,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11271,"from_id":22316,"to_id":22315,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11274,"from_id":22323,"to_id":22322,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11252,"from_id":22285,"to_id":22284,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11253,"from_id":22287,"to_id":22288,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11255,"from_id":22293,"to_id":22291,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11256,"from_id":22293,"to_id":22290,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11258,"from_id":22295,"to_id":22296,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11265,"from_id":22305,"to_id":22304,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11267,"from_id":22309,"to_id":22310,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11268,"from_id":22309,"to_id":22306,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11272,"from_id":22316,"to_id":22317,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11273,"from_id":22318,"to_id":22319,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11275,"from_id":22323,"to_id":22321,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11254,"from_id":22293,"to_id":22292,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11257,"from_id":22293,"to_id":22289,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11259,"from_id":22295,"to_id":22297,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11260,"from_id":22295,"to_id":22298,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11261,"from_id":22302,"to_id":22299,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11262,"from_id":22302,"to_id":22300,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11263,"from_id":22302,"to_id":22301,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11264,"from_id":22295,"to_id":22294,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11266,"from_id":22305,"to_id":22303,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":1666,"text":"#Symptoms - Osteoarthritis - FA0Z\nThe main symptoms of OA are pain, loss of ability, and “joint stiffness after exercise or use.” These symptoms are often aggravated by activity or rigorous exercise and relieved during rest. The disease may eventually progress to the point where the patient even feels pain during rest. Some people report pain so intense that it wakes them up when they are sleeping. Knee or hip pain may lead to reduced physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle that may increase the weight gain and further obesity. Being overweight or obese can lead to the development of diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. People with OA have greater chances of fall and fracture than those without OA due to presence of risk factors such as decreased function of joints, muscle weakness and impaired balance.","entities":[{"id":22325,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":55,"end_offset":57},{"id":22326,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":62,"end_offset":66},{"id":22327,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":68,"end_offset":83},{"id":22329,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":225,"end_offset":236},{"id":22334,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":505,"end_offset":516},{"id":22336,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":538,"end_offset":554},{"id":22341,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":656,"end_offset":658},{"id":22342,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":720,"end_offset":722},{"id":22344,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":763,"end_offset":791},{"id":22324,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":26},{"id":22328,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":91,"end_offset":127},{"id":22330,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":340,"end_offset":344},{"id":22331,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":402,"end_offset":418},{"id":22332,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":431,"end_offset":456},{"id":22333,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":463,"end_offset":482},{"id":22335,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":529,"end_offset":536},{"id":22337,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":558,"end_offset":563},{"id":22338,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":595,"end_offset":603},{"id":22339,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":605,"end_offset":618},{"id":22340,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":623,"end_offset":642},{"id":22345,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":793,"end_offset":808},{"id":22346,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":813,"end_offset":829}],"relations":[{"id":11279,"from_id":22324,"to_id":22331,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":11280,"from_id":22338,"to_id":22337,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11285,"from_id":22340,"to_id":22336,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11286,"from_id":22342,"to_id":22344,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11288,"from_id":22342,"to_id":22346,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11276,"from_id":22325,"to_id":22326,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":11277,"from_id":22325,"to_id":22327,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":11278,"from_id":22325,"to_id":22328,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":11281,"from_id":22338,"to_id":22336,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11282,"from_id":22339,"to_id":22337,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11283,"from_id":22339,"to_id":22336,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11284,"from_id":22340,"to_id":22337,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":11287,"from_id":22342,"to_id":22345,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":1667,"text":"#Treatment - Osteoarthritis - FA0Z\nApart from the traditional non-pharmacological approaches pulsed ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, electro-acupuncture, and low level laser therapy are newer therapies. Pharmacological therapy- The primary strategy for pharmacological management of OA is to control pain and improve function and quality of life for the patient, while limiting drug toxicity as there is no cure for OA. Paracetamol (Acetaminophen): Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a commonly prescribed oral analgesic to treat mild to moderate OA pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs can be used for relieving pain in OA (However, treatment with NSAIDs is associated with gastrointestinal effects and potential toxicity, especially in the elderly persons). New classes of NSAIDS called Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX’2) inhibitors are also in use (one of the class, refecoxib was found to increase the risk of cardiovascular events and was withdrawn in 2004, celecoxib and eterocoxib are in use). Topical NSAIDs, in the form of cream, patches, gels, solutions, have been found to be effective in reducing pain associated with musculoskeletal conditions, including OA. The benefit of topical NSAIDs is that they eliminate the gastrointestinal side effects of oral treatment. However, they have been associated with certain local adverse effects and they may be less effective than oral NSAIDs. Opioids may be used for pain relief in patients who cannot use either NSAIDs or acetaminophen; however drug abuse is high with opioids. Intra-articular corticosteroids: Treatment with corticosteroids injected directly into the joint (intra-articular) has been shown to be effective, especially in OA of the knee. Viscosupplementation: This involves a series of injections of either hyaluronan or hylan products (hyaluronan is a polysaccharide and is one of the main components of the extracellular matrix). Surgical Management- Joint replacement surgery: Patients who experience severe pain and show extensive narrowing of joint space and medicines are not effective; these patients are eligible for joint replacement surgery. Joint replacement surgery is removing a damaged joint and putting in an artificial one (A joint is where two or more bones come together, like the knee, hip, and shoulder). Osteotomy: Osteotomy is the cutting and reshaping of bones with the purpose of altering the area of the joint which bears weight. Arthroscopic debridement and lavage are two processes that involve removing damaged cartilage, bone, and excess debris surrounding the joint.","entities":[{"id":22388,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":1959,"end_offset":1984},{"id":22390,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":2026,"end_offset":2065},{"id":22391,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2131,"end_offset":2156},{"id":22393,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":2248,"end_offset":2253},{"id":22394,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":2275,"end_offset":2280},{"id":22396,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":2311,"end_offset":2314},{"id":22397,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":2320,"end_offset":2328},{"id":22401,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2461,"end_offset":2485},{"id":22402,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":2206,"end_offset":2211},{"id":22404,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2490,"end_offset":2496},{"id":22348,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":27},{"id":22349,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":93,"end_offset":110},{"id":22351,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":157,"end_offset":176},{"id":22353,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":227,"end_offset":250},{"id":22354,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":277,"end_offset":303},{"id":22357,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":444,"end_offset":471},{"id":22359,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":567,"end_offset":569},{"id":22361,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":624,"end_offset":630},{"id":22362,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":665,"end_offset":667},{"id":22363,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":693,"end_offset":699},{"id":22364,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":819,"end_offset":825},{"id":22366,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1043,"end_offset":1049},{"id":22369,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":997,"end_offset":1006},{"id":22370,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1011,"end_offset":1021},{"id":22371,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":904,"end_offset":913},{"id":22374,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1202,"end_offset":1204},{"id":22375,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1229,"end_offset":1235},{"id":22377,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1431,"end_offset":1438},{"id":22378,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1501,"end_offset":1507},{"id":22380,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1567,"end_offset":1598},{"id":22382,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1728,"end_offset":1730},{"id":22383,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1738,"end_offset":1742},{"id":22384,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1744,"end_offset":1764},{"id":22350,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":112,"end_offset":155},{"id":22352,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":182,"end_offset":205},{"id":22355,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":307,"end_offset":309},{"id":22356,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":440,"end_offset":442},{"id":22358,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":473,"end_offset":500},{"id":22360,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":576,"end_offset":622},{"id":22365,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":833,"end_offset":857},{"id":22372,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":948,"end_offset":969},{"id":22376,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1423,"end_offset":1429},{"id":22379,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1511,"end_offset":1524},{"id":22381,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1615,"end_offset":1630},{"id":22385,"label":"Composition_E","start_offset":1813,"end_offset":1823},{"id":22386,"label":"Composition_E","start_offset":1827,"end_offset":1841},{"id":22387,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":1938,"end_offset":1957},{"id":22389,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":2010,"end_offset":2021},{"id":22392,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2158,"end_offset":2183},{"id":22395,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":2305,"end_offset":2309},{"id":22398,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2331,"end_offset":2340},{"id":22399,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":2342,"end_offset":2351},{"id":22400,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":2435,"end_offset":2440},{"id":22403,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":2384,"end_offset":2389},{"id":22405,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":2545,"end_offset":2554},{"id":22406,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":2556,"end_offset":2560},{"id":22407,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":2596,"end_offset":2601}],"relations":[{"id":11289,"from_id":22349,"to_id":22348,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11290,"from_id":22350,"to_id":22348,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11291,"from_id":22351,"to_id":22348,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11293,"from_id":22353,"to_id":22355,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11294,"from_id":22354,"to_id":22355,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11295,"from_id":22358,"to_id":22359,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11297,"from_id":22365,"to_id":22348,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11299,"from_id":22371,"to_id":22372,"type":"has_side_effect_R"},{"id":11301,"from_id":22370,"to_id":22348,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11302,"from_id":22377,"to_id":22348,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11303,"from_id":22380,"to_id":22348,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11304,"from_id":22382,"to_id":22383,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":11305,"from_id":22381,"to_id":22382,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":11306,"from_id":22384,"to_id

The term factitious disorders describe conditions where physical findings are intentionally produced by person to assume sick role. Factitious disorder most commonly occurs during second or third decade of life, and more often among health professionals. Factitious disease affecting eyes is commonly seen in nasal or inferior quadrant of the eye.

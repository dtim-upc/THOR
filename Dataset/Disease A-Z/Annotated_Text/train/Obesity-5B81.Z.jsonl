{"id":1401,"text":"#Causes - Obesity - 5B81.Z\nObesity doesn't occur overnight. It develops gradually over time when there is disturbance in energy balance. The reasons for the imbalance between calorie intake and energy out may vary from individual to individual. Genes may affect the amount of fat storage and distribution of fat in body. Overweight and obesity tend to run in families not just because of genetics but family members tend to share similar eating and activity habits. Diet rich in calories (fast foods), high calorie beverages, oversized portions, bad eating habits (eating between meals, preference to sweets, refined foods, and fats), diet lacking with fruits and vegetables; all these factors contribute to weight gain. With a sedentary lifestyle such as sedentary occupation and inactive recreation (watching television) more calories are stored in the body every day than used through exercise. Certain medicines such as corticosteroids, antidepressants and medicines used for seizure control may cause weight gain. For some people, eating habits are influenced by emotions such as sadness, stress, boredom or anger and they react by eating excessively. Quitting smoking is often associated with weight gain. Woman gain weight during pregnancy and, some women find it difficult to lose weight after child birth. Not having enough sleep or getting too much sleep can cause changes in hormones that may increase appetite and craving for foods high in calories and carbohydrates, which can contribute to weight gain.

{"id":1403,"text":"#Overview - Obesity - 5B81.Z\nObesity is a condition where a person has accumulated abnormal or excessive body fat that causes negative effects on health. For an individual, obesity is usually the result of an imbalance between calories consumed and calories expanded. An increased consumption of high calorie foods, without an equal increase in physical activity leads to an increase in weight. Decreased levels of physical activity will also result in an energy imbalance and lead to weight gain. World Health Organization (WHO) defines overweight and obesity as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A simple measure commonly used to classify overweight and obesity in adults is body mass index (BMI).  BMI is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg\/m2). WHO identifies overweight when BMI is greater than or equal to 25; and obesity when BMI is greater or equal to 30. In Asians, the cut-offs for overweight (≥23.0kg\/m2) and obesity (≥25.0kg\/m2) are lower than WHO criteria due to risk factors and morbidities.","entities":[{"id":19490,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":485,"end_offset":496},{"id":19482,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":19},{"id":19487,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":268,"end_offset":362},{"id":19483,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":29,"end_offset":36},{"id":19484,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":83,"end_offset":113},{"id":19485,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":173,"end_offset":180},{"id":19486,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":209,"end_offset":266},{"id":19488,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":375,"end_offset":393},{"id":19489,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":395,"end_offset":472}],"relations":[{"id":9597,"from_id":19483,"to_id":19484,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":9598,"from_id":19485,"to_id":19486,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":9599,"from_id":19488,"to_id":19487,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9600,"from_id":19490,"to_id":19489,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

DSM-5 Diagnostic criteria: There are three types of presentations based on nine symptoms each of inattention and hyperactivity\/impulsivity as mentioned above. ADHD predominantly inattentive presentation: Children have six or more symptoms of inattention and fewer than six symptoms of hyperactivity\/impulsivity. ADHD predominantly hyperactivity\/impulsivity presentation: Children have six or more symptoms of hyperactivity\/impulsivity and fewer than six symptoms of inattention. ADHD combined presentation: It is diagnosed when full criteria from both the lists are met. Older adolescents and adults require only five symptoms from either (or both) of the two criteria lists. Differential diagnosis: Special learning disorders, Mood disorders, Sleep disorders, Depression, Anxiety, Substance use, Rare genetic disorders e.g. tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis type 1, and Turner syndrome.","entities":[{"id":8293,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":451,"end_offset":476},{"id":8294,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":575,"end_offset":600},{"id":8296,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":866,"end_offset":892},{"id":8301,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":948,"end_offset":961},{"id":8283,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":53},{"id":8290,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":263,"end_offset":275},{"id":8284,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":80,"end_offset":85},{"id":8291,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":279,"end_offset":304},{"id":8292,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":408,"end_offset":420},{"id":8295,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":632,"end_offset":643},{"id":8297,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":894,"end_offset":908},{"id":8298,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":910,"end_offset":925},{"id":8299,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":927,"end_offset":937},{"id":8300,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":939,"end_offset":946},{"id":8302,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":963,"end_offset":1056}],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

Symptoms of over-activity, inattention, and impulsivity drive this impairment even later. General symptoms: 1. Symptoms of Inattention: a. Often fails to give close attention, b. Often has difficulty in sustaining attention, c. Often does not seem to listen, d. Often does not follow through on instructions, e. Often has difficulty organising tasks and activities, f. Often dislikes, avoids, or is reluctant to engage in tasks, g. Is often easily distracted, h. Often loses things. 2. Symptoms of Hyperactivity and Impulsivity: a. Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet or squirms in seat. b. Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected. c. Often runs about or climbs in situations where it is inappropriate. d. Often unable to play or engage in leisure activities quietly. e. Is often ‘on the go’, acting as if ‘driven by a motor’. f. Often talks excessively. g. Often has difficulty waiting his or her turn. h. Often blurts out an answer before a question has been completed. i. Often interrupts or intrudes on others.

Pharmacologic interventions: Evidence suggests that Stimulants are more effective than Non- stimulants. Stimulants: Amphetamines and Methylphenidate (MPH). Stimulants are considered first-line agents to treat ADHD. Non- stimulants: Non-responders or those who experience adverse effects to stimulants may be prescribed non-stimulants. Guanfacine, Clonidine, and atomoxetine are the approved drugs for ADHD treatment. Other medications: Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs): TCAs are used infrequently as they have more serious side-effects. Co-morbid conditions such as anxiety, mood, and seizure disorders should be treated accordingly. American Academy of Paediatrics guidelines for the management of ADHD, recommends that pharmacologic intervention should be the first line of treatment in most cases.

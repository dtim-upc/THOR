It may be paralytic, because of facial intracranial nerve involving the orbicularis oculi muscle, or spastic, as is seen in thyrotoxicosis. Excessive protrusion of the globe in the orbit: Lagophthalmos may accompany proptosis or buphthalmos (enlarged cornea due to elevated intraocular pressure in small children), in spite of normal eyelids, which fail to cover the proptosed eye. Inadequate vertical dimension of either upper or lower eyelid: It may be structural when retraction or shortening of the eyelids results from scarring or atrophy following injury (e.g. burns) or a disease.

{"id":1157,"text":"#Overview - Lagophthalmos - 9A03.4Z\nLagophthalmos is the inability to close the eyelids completely on attempted closure. The term lagophthalmos is derived from the Greek word ‘lagos’ which means ‘hare’, since the hare was believed to sleep with its eyes open. Closure of eyelids is primarily a function of the descending upper eyelid. The lower eyelid exhibits very little upward movement during closure of eyes. Because of this, many patients tolerate lower eyelid retraction with minimal or no symptoms, as long as the upper eyelid retains normal movement.","entities":[{"id":16769,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":36,"end_offset":49},{"id":16770,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":57,"end_offset":98},{"id":16773,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":321,"end_offset":333},{"id":16775,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":407,"end_offset":411},{"id":16776,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":453,"end_offset":465},{"id":16777,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":521,"end_offset":533},{"id":16768,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":25},{"id":16771,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":130,"end_offset":143},{"id":16772,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":271,"end_offset":278},{"id":16774,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":339,"end_offset":351}],"relations":[{"id":8117,"from_id":16769,"to_id":16770,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

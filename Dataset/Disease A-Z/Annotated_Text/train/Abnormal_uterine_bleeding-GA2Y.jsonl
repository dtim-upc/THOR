Laboratory Testing: A complete blood count (CBC), full blood count test should be carried out on all women with HMB to detect anaemia, Blood type and cross match, Urine pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. Imaging: Ultrasonography is used in AUB cases to evaluate uterus, adnexa and endometrial thickness. Transvaginal ultrasonography may reveal leiomyoma, endometrial thickening, or focal masses. Sonohysterography: It is more specific and sensitive in diagnosing lesions inside the uterine cavity and endometrial hyperplasia. Hysteroscopy: It is an examination of the uterine cavity and the surface of the endometrium (inner lining of uterus) using a hysteroscope for diagnosis and characterization of intrauterine abnormalities. MRI (magnetic resonance Imaging): MRI can be used to differentiate between fibroids and adenomyosis and for mapping exact location of fibroids while planning conservative surgery and prior to therapeutic embolization for fibroids.","entities":[{"id":7275,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":298,"end_offset":326},{"id":7276,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":328,"end_offset":349},{"id":7277,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":404,"end_offset":411},{"id":7279,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":485,"end_offset":492},{"id":7281,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":521,"end_offset":525},{"id":7284,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":562,"end_offset":583},{"id":7285,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":585,"end_offset":613},{"id":7286,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":625,"end_offset":634},{"id":7287,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":677,"end_offset":694},{"id":7288,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":733,"end_offset":744},{"id":7290,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":782,"end_offset":805},{"id":7291,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":807,"end_offset":819},{"id":7292,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":845,"end_offset":863},{"id":7294,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":949,"end_offset":959},{"id":7297,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1011,"end_offset":1043},{"id":7301,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":1169,"end_offset":1189},{"id":7278,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":441,"end_offset":461},{"id":7280,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":494,"end_offset":510},{"id":7282,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":543,"end_offset":549},{"id":7283,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":551,"end_offset":558},{"id":7289,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":763,"end_offset":777},{"id":7293,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":932,"end_offset":945},{"id":7295,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":983,"end_offset":1009},{"id":7296,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":883,"end_offset":923},{"id":7298,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1086,"end_offset":1095},{"id":7299,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1099,"end_offset":1111},{"id":7300,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1145,"end_offset":1154},{"id":7302,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1203,"end_offset":1241},{"id":7266,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":38},{"id":7267,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":46,"end_offset":57},{"id":7268,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":59,"end_offset":79},{"id":7269,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":100,"end_offset":104},{"id":7270,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":195,"end_offset":214},{"id":7271,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":216,"end_offset":243},{"id":7272,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":245,"end_offset":276},{"id":7273,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":114,"end_offset":180},{"id":7274,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":278,"end_offset":296}],"relations":[{"id":3142,"from_id":7269,"to_id":7268,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3143,"from_id":7269,"to_id":7267,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3144,"from_id":7269,"to_id":7273,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3145,"from_id":7269,"to_id":7270,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3146,"from_id":7269,"to_id":7271,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3147,"from_id":7269,"to_id":7272,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3148,"from_id":7281,"to_id":7280,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3149,"from_id":7281,"to_id":7279,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3150,"from_id":7266,"to_id":7274,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3151,"from_id":7266,"to_id":7275,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3152,"from_id":7266,"to_id":7276,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3153,"from_id":7266,"to_id":7278,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3154,"from_id":7280,"to_id":7282,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":3155,"from_id":7280,"to_id":7283,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":3156,"from_id":7281,"to_id":7284,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":3157,"from_id":7285,"to_id":7286,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":3158,"from_id":7266,"to_id":7285,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3159,"from_id":7266,"to_id":7287,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3181,"from_id":7266,"to_id":7288,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3182,"from_id":7266,"to_id":7291,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3183,"from_id":7266,"to_id":7297,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3184,"from_id":7297,"to_id":7298,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":3185,"from_id":7297,"to_id":7299,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":3187,"from_id":7297,"to_id":7301,"type":"needs_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":392,"text":"#Causes - Abnormal uterine bleeding - GA2Y\nThe components of the PALM group are structural causes that can be located visually with imaging techniques and\/or histopathology. These causes are polyp; adenomyosis; leiomyoma; malignancy and hyperplasia. Polyp (AUB-P): Uterine polyps are growths from endometrium, (inner lining of the uterus) found into the uterine cavity. These are usually benign but some may be precancerous or cancerous.  Adenomyosis (AUB-A): This is a condition in which the inner lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows in to the muscle wall of the uterus ( myometrium). Leiomyoma (AUB-L): These are benign fibromuscular tumors of the myometrium. Leiomyomas are known by several names, including myoma, and fibroid. Malignancy and hyperplasia (AUB-M): Malignancy and atypical hyperplasia are associated with, AUB and must be considered in nearly all women of reproductive age. Coagulopathy (AUB-C): The term coagulopathy includes the systemic disorders of hemostasis that may be associated with AUB. Ovulatory dysfunction: Disorders of ovulation may present as different menstrual abnormalities ranging from amenorrhea (absence of periods), extremely light and infrequent bleeding, to unpredictable heavy menstrual bleeding. Endometrial (AUB-E): When uterine bleeding occurs due of the abnormalities of endometrium with normal ovulatory function, and without any coagulopathy it is known as AUB-E. Iatrogenic (AUB-I): Abnormal uterine bleeding associated with the use of exogenous gonadal steroids, intrauterine devices, or other systemic or local agents is classified as iatrogenic (AUB-I). Not yet classified (AUB-N): A category of “not yet classified” was created to accommodate entities that are rarely encountered or are ill-defined.","entities":[{"id":7363,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":297,"end_offset":308},{"id":7364,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":354,"end_offset":368},{"id":7365,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":411,"end_offset":424},{"id":7366,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":427,"end_offset":436},{"id":7367,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":439,"end_offset":458},{"id":7368,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":493,"end_offset":533},{"id":7370,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":591,"end_offset":608},{"id":7372,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":667,"end_offset":678},{"id":7373,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":736,"end_offset":771},{"id":7378,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1015,"end_offset":1018},{"id":7381,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1020,"end_offset":1041},{"id":7383,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1091,"end_offset":1114},{"id":7351,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":132,"end_offset":150},{"id":7353,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":211,"end_offset":220},{"id":7354,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":198,"end_offset":209},{"id":7356,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":222,"end_offset":232},{"id":7357,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":237,"end_offset":248},{"id":7419,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1245,"end_offset":1264},{"id":7420,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1411,"end_offset":1416},{"id":7421,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1302,"end_offset":1365},{"id":7423,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1438,"end_offset":1463},{"id":7348,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":35},{"id":7350,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":158,"end_offset":172},{"id":7352,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":191,"end_offset":196},{"id":7359,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":250,"end_offset":263},{"id":7422,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1418,"end_offset":1436},{"id":7424,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1491,"end_offset":1517},{"id":7425,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1592,"end_offset":1610},{"id":7426,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1612,"end_offset":1638},{"id":7362,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":265,"end_offset":279},{"id":7369,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":546,"end_offset":590},{"id":7371,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":620,"end_offset":665},{"id":7374,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":829,"end_offset":833},{"id":7375,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":897,"end_offset":918},{"id":7379,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":954,"end_offset":986},{"id":7382,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1043,"end_offset":1065}],"relations":[{"id":3218,"from_id":7348,"to_id":7375,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3221,"from_id":7348,"to_id":7422,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3222,"from_id":7348,"to_id":7424,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3223,"from_id":7348,"to_id":7425,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3219,"from_id":7348,"to_id":7381,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3220,"from_id":7348,"to_id":7419,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3224,"from_id":7348,"to_id":7426,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3188,"from_id":7348,"to_id":7352,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3189,"from_id":7348,"to_id":7354,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3190,"from_id":7348,"to_id":7353,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3191,"from_id":7348,"to_id":7356,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3192,"from_id":7348,"to_id":7357,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3193,"from_id":7348,"to_id":7359,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3195,"from_id":7374,"to_id":7373,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":395,"text":"#Treatment - Abnormal uterine bleeding - GA2Y\nMedical therapy is considered the preferred initial treatment. Conservative and uterine-preserving treatment options are used initially; however, ineffective medical treatment and certain situations need prompt surgical management. Surgery- When AUB does not respond to medical therapy, a surgical procedure is required to control the bleeding. Surgical treatment is based on the clinical diagnosis, the severity of bleeding, contraindications and response  to medical management, the underlying medical condition, age and fertility status of women (whether she wants to have children). Hysteroscopic surgical removal of polyp- Polyps that cause AUB can be removed for controlling symptoms and even asymptomatic polyps need to be removed to exclude the chances of cancer. Endometrial ablation destroys the lining of the uterus. It stops or reduces the total amount of bleeding. Uterine artery embolization is a procedure used to treat fibroids. This procedure blocks the blood vessels to the uterus, which in turn stops the blood flow that fibroids need to grow.

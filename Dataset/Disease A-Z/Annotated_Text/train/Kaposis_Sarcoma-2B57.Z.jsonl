Skin: In skin they commonly affect areas that include the lower limbs, back, face, mouth, and genitalia. The lesions are usually plaque-like. Associated swelling may be from either local inflammation or lymphedema (local lymphatic vessels of the lesion). Skin lesions may be quite disfiguring and a cause of much psychosocial pathology. Internal organs: The internal organs most commonly affected by Kaposi’s sarcoma are the lymph nodes, lungs and the digestive system. The symptoms of Kaposi’s sarcoma depend on which organs are affected. When the lymph nodes are affected, there may be swelling in the arms and legs which can be very painful and uncomfortable.","entities":[{"id":15907,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":27},{"id":15908,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":65,"end_offset":73},{"id":15909,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":117,"end_offset":126},{"id":15910,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":128,"end_offset":151},{"id":15911,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":156,"end_offset":173},{"id":15913,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":233,"end_offset":244},{"id":15916,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":258,"end_offset":263},{"id":15917,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":269,"end_offset":278},{"id":15918,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":280,"end_offset":315},{"id":15925,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":623,"end_offset":643},{"id":15926,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":661,"end_offset":677},{"id":15912,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":175,"end_offset":179},{"id":15914,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":246,"end_offset":250},{"id":15915,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":252,"end_offset":256},{"id":15919,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":317,"end_offset":388},{"id":15920,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":430,"end_offset":510},{"id":15921,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":512,"end_offset":527},{"id":15922,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":575,"end_offset":591},{"id":15923,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":600,"end_offset":611},{"id":15924,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":613,"end_offset":618},{"id":15927,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":720,"end_offset":735},{"id":15928,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":763,"end_offset":836}],"relations":[{"id":7677,"from_id":15907,"to_id":15919,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":7678,"from_id":15907,"to_id":15920,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":7680,"from_id":15922,"to_id":15923,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":7681,"from_id":15922,"to_id":15924,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":7676,"from_id":15907,"to_id":15918,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":7679,"from_id":15922,"to_id":15921,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":7682,"from_id":15922,"to_id":15925,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":7683,"from_id":15907,"to_id":15928,"type":"has_symptom_R"}],"Comments":[]}

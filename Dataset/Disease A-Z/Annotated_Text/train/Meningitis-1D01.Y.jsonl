{"id":1650,"text":"#Causes - Meningitis - 1D01.Y\nMeningitis is typically caused by an infection with microorganisms. Most infections are due to viruses with bacteria, fungi, and protozoa being the next most common causes. Broadly, there are five types of meningitis: Bacterial meningitis, which is caused by bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis or Streptococcus pneumoniae and spread through close contact. Viral meningitis, which is caused by viruses that can be spread through coughing, sneezing and poor hygiene. Parasitic meningitis, Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a very rare form of parasitic meningitis that causes a fatal brain infection. Fungal meningitis, Fungal meningitis is rare and is usually carried by blood to the meninges.

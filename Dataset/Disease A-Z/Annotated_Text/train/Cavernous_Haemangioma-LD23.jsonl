{"id":748,"text":"#Diagnosis - Cavernous Haemangioma - LD23\nClinically, superficial lesions are lobulated, compressible, dark blue coloured, and slowly progressive lesions. These lesions may produce amblyopia due to mass effect of ptosis or from astigmatism produced by ocular compression. Histopathology: Cavernous haemangiomas show endothelium lined, large dilated blood filled spaces. These vascular spaces are separated by fibrous stroma. These tumours are well circumscribed but are not encapsulated. There may be signs of focal chronic inflammation. There is no endothelial proliferation unlike acquired capillary haemangioma of eyelid. There may be thrombosis or foci of calcification.","entities":[{"id":11709,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":161,"end_offset":169},{"id":11710,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":66,"end_offset":74},{"id":11711,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":181,"end_offset":191},{"id":11730,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":198,"end_offset":270},{"id":11731,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":272,"end_offset":286},{"id":11738,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":288,"end_offset":310},{"id":11750,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":316,"end_offset":368},{"id":11753,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":409,"end_offset":423},{"id":11757,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":431,"end_offset":439},{"id":11758,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":510,"end_offset":536},{"id":11708,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":34},{"id":11769,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":583,"end_offset":623},{"id":11773,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":638,"end_offset":673}],"relations":[{"id":5512,"from_id":11708,"to_id":11731,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":5513,"from_id":11708,"to_id":11753,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":750,"text":"#Overview - Cavernous Haemangioma - LD23\nCavernous Haemangioma of Eyelid is a hamartoma, which arises usually after the second decade of life. Eyelid lesion is less common as compared to orbital tumour. It usually accompanies the orbital tumour and the occurrence of isolated eyelid lesion is rare. Sinusoidal haemangioma, a subtype of cavernous haemangioma, involves eyelid with aggressive growth pattern. It invades adjacent eyebrow and cheek. Blue rubber bleb naevus syndrome, a rare entity, is characterised by multiple cutaneous cavernous haemangiomas associated with gastrointestinal haemangiomas which often bleed.","entities":[{"id":11794,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":33},{"id":11796,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":78,"end_offset":87},{"id":11795,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":41,"end_offset":72},{"id":11805,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":143,"end_offset":156},{"id":11810,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":187,"end_offset":201},{"id":11831,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":534,"end_offset":556},{"id":11820,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":299,"end_offset":321},{"id":11822,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":336,"end_offset":357},{"id":11824,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":407,"end_offset":410},{"id":11825,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":418,"end_offset":444},{"id":11830,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":446,"end_offset":478},{"id":11832,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":573,"end_offset":602}],"relations":[{"id":5548,"from_id":11795,"to_id":11796,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":5549,"from_id":11824,"to_id":11825,"type":"affects_R"}],"Comments":[]}

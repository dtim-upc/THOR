{"id":1095,"text":"#Overview - Ichthyosis - 5C81.0\nIchthyosis is a generalized, mostly genetic disorder of the skin. All types of ichthyosis have dry, thickened, scaly or flaky skin. There is no cure, but symptoms are usually mild and manageable with a daily skin care routine. The severity of symptoms can vary extremely, from the mildest types such as ichthyosis vulgaris which may be mistaken for normal dry skin up to life-threatening conditions such as harlequin type ichthyosis. The most common type of ichthyosis is ichthyosis vulgaris, accounting for more than 95% of cases.","entities":[{"id":15848,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":22},{"id":15849,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":32,"end_offset":42},{"id":15851,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":88,"end_offset":96},{"id":15854,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":240,"end_offset":249},{"id":15850,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":68,"end_offset":84},{"id":15852,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":111,"end_offset":121},{"id":15853,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":127,"end_offset":162},{"id":15855,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":335,"end_offset":354},{"id":15856,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":388,"end_offset":396},{"id":15857,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":403,"end_offset":430},{"id":15858,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":439,"end_offset":464},{"id":15859,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":490,"end_offset":500},{"id":15860,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":504,"end_offset":523}],"relations":[{"id":7642,"from_id":15849,"to_id":15850,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":7643,"from_id":15850,"to_id":15851,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":7644,"from_id":15852,"to_id":15853,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":7645,"from_id":15855,"to_id":15856,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":7646,"from_id":15855,"to_id":15857,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":7647,"from_id":15855,"to_id":15858,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

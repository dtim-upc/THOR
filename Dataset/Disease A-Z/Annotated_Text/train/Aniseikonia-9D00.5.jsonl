{"id":408,"text":"#Diagnosis - Aniseikonia - 9D00.5\nDiagnosis depends upon clinical symptoms and retinoscopic examination in patients with defective visual acuity. Clinical aniseikonia may be defined as the amount of aniseikonia that is necessary to correct to eliminate symptoms. It usually occurs when the difference in image size between two eyes approaches 0.75%. Clinical types of aniseikonia: Aniseikonia may be either symmetrical or asymmetrical. Symmetrical aniseikonia: In symmetrical aniseikonia, one image is larger than the other, either in all dimensions or in one meridian only. This difference in meridian may be oblique. Overall aniseikonia, Meridional or cylindrical aniseikonia, Compound aniseikonia. Asymmetrical aniseikonia: In asymmetrical aniseikonia, the image is distorted in some degree. This may be: Prismatic type, Pincushion type, Barrel type, Oblique type. Tests for aniseikonia: An eikonometer is an instrument used to detect and measure aniseikonia. There are two basic types of eikonometer, the direct eikonometer and the space eikonometer. Clinically, a simple printed direct comparison aniseikonia test and a computerised test is available to analyse aniseikonia.","entities":[{"id":7320,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":79,"end_offset":103},{"id":7322,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":199,"end_offset":211},{"id":7323,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":263,"end_offset":266},{"id":7324,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":368,"end_offset":379},{"id":7325,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":381,"end_offset":393},{"id":7328,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":619,"end_offset":638},{"id":7330,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":679,"end_offset":699},{"id":7331,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":701,"end_offset":725},{"id":7332,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":730,"end_offset":754},{"id":7335,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":950,"end_offset":961},{"id":7338,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1009,"end_offset":1027},{"id":7340,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1067,"end_offset":1118},{"id":7342,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1167,"end_offset":1178},{"id":7321,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":146,"end_offset":166},{"id":7326,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":436,"end_offset":459},{"id":7327,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":464,"end_offset":487},{"id":7329,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":640,"end_offset":677},{"id":7333,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":868,"end_offset":874},{"id":7334,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":878,"end_offset":889},{"id":7336,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":894,"end_offset":906},{"id":7337,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":992,"end_offset":1003},{"id":7339,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1036,"end_offset":1053},{"id":7341,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1123,"end_offset":1142},{"id":7319,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":25}],"relations":[{"id":3172,"from_id":7319,"to_id":7320,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3173,"from_id":7334,"to_id":7336,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3176,"from_id":7319,"to_id":7338,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3177,"from_id":7319,"to_id":7339,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3179,"from_id":7342,"to_id":7341,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3180,"from_id":7342,"to_id":7340,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":409,"text":"#Overview - Aniseikonia - 9D00.5\nAniseikonia is defined as a difference in the shape and\/or size of images presented to the visual cortex by two eyes. The brain is unable to fuse two images, resulting in an extra ghost image or diplopia. Aniseikonia is often produced due to significant amount of anisometropia, especially when it is corrected by spectacles instead of contact lenses.  It is difficult to detect aniseikonia based on history and clinical examination. Aniseikonia precludes fusion of images when the degree is large. Despite this, it is rare that a patient volunteer a difference in image size and\/or shape between the two eyes.

{"id":1348,"text":"#Overview - Filamentary Keratitis - 9A78.Z\nFilamentary keratitis is a chronic disorder in which filaments, which are adherent complexes of mucus and corneal epithelium, are present on the corneal surface. Filaments consist of a variable combination of degenerated epithelial cells and mucous which are attached to the corneal surface at one end.  Filamentary keratitis can be a functionally debilitating and sight threatening feature of a number of ocular and systemic conditions such as: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye syndrome), Exposure keratitis, Adenoviral keratitis, Bacterial keratitis, Acne rosacea, Systemic use of antihistamines.","entities":[{"id":18986,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":33},{"id":18987,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":43,"end_offset":64},{"id":18989,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":70,"end_offset":167},{"id":18990,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":188,"end_offset":203},{"id":18992,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":264,"end_offset":280},{"id":18994,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":318,"end_offset":333},{"id":18995,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":347,"end_offset":368},{"id":18996,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":378,"end_offset":479},{"id":19000,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":578,"end_offset":597},{"id":19001,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":599,"end_offset":611},{"id":19002,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":613,"end_offset":643},{"id":18991,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":205,"end_offset":215},{"id":18993,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":285,"end_offset":292},{"id":18997,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":489,"end_offset":534},{"id":18998,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":536,"end_offset":554},{"id":18999,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":556,"end_offset":576}],"relations":[{"id":9287,"from_id":18987,"to_id":18989,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":9289,"from_id":18995,"to_id":18997,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":9291,"from_id":18995,"to_id":18999,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":9292,"from_id":18995,"to_id":19000,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":9294,"from_id":18995,"to_id":19002,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":9288,"from_id":18995,"to_id":18996,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":9290,"from_id":18995,"to_id":18998,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":9293,"from_id":18995,"to_id":19001,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":1349,"text":"#Diagnosis - Filamentary Keratitis - 9A78.Z\nDiagnosis of filamentary keratitis is based on the clinical history and slit lamp examination (bio-microscopy), being conducted by an eye specialist. Signs on slit lamp examination: Corneal filaments (mucoepithelioid strands): There may be multiple small, grey, mucoid filamentary attachments, firmly adherent to the corneal surface. Location of the filament may help determine the underlying cause, Filaments in dry eye syndrome and exposure keratopathy: Filaments in dry eye syndrome and exposure keratopathy are usually found in the interpalpebral space. Filaments due to ptosis, prolonged lid closure or superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis: Filaments due to ptosis, prolonged lid closure or superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis are seen superiorly on cornea.

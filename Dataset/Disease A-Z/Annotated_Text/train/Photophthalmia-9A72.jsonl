{"id":1993,"text":"#Diagnosis - Photophthalmia - 9A72\nDiagnosis depends upon the clinical history and signs observed on examination. The symptoms in eye appear characteristically after a latent period of 4- 5 hours of exposure to ultra-violet light. There is intense burning pain, foreign body sensation, and watering of eyes. There is associated marked photophobia and blepharospasm. On slit-lamp examination, corneal epithelium shows breach in continuity of epithelium which takes up fluorescein sodium stain. In severe cases, the epithelium of the cornea is detached, which may result in corneal erosion. There is conjunctival erythema (redness).

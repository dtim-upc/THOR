{"id":1307,"text":"#Causes - Keratoglobus - LA11.1\nCauses of Keratoglobus may be: Congenital: Keratoglobus is primarily considered a congenital disorder present since birth. The congenital form of the disorder is always bilateral. The exact genetics of the disorder have not been studied in detail and no definite inheritance pattern has been described. It is assumed to be autosomal recessive. It has also been associated with: - Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type VI: Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type VI is distinct for its ocular manifestations. These include corneal abnormalities of cornea plana, keratoconus and keratoglobus, blue sclera, and ocular fragility. Other systemic features in this type are the presence of hypermobile joints, skeletal abnormalities like scoliosis, pectus excavatum, a marfanoid habitus, and hearing loss. Skin laxity and fragility is not a characteristic finding, unlike in other types of Ehlers–Danlos syndromes, and lysyl hydroxylase activity may be normal. - Marfan syndrome. - Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome. - Blue sclera syndromes: Blue sclera syndromes may be the manifestation of syndromes like Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type VI or osteogenesis imperfecta. - Leber’s congenital amaurosis. Acquired: In recent years, there have been reports of acquired forms of keratoglobus. It has been associated with disorders such as: - Vernal keratoconjunctivitis. - Chronic marginal blepharitis. - Dysthyroid ophthalmopathy. - Idiopathic orbital inflammation.","entities":[{"id":18549,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":22},{"id":18550,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":42,"end_offset":54},{"id":18551,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":63,"end_offset":73},{"id":18553,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":412,"end_offset":442},{"id":18554,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":444,"end_offset":474},{"id":18555,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":557,"end_offset":569},{"id":18556,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":571,"end_offset":582},{"id":18557,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":587,"end_offset":599},{"id":18559,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":618,"end_offset":634},{"id":18552,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":75,"end_offset":87},{"id":18558,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":601,"end_offset":612},{"id":18560,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":693,"end_offset":711},{"id":18563,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":752,"end_offset":768},{"id":18566,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":809,"end_offset":834},{"id":18567,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":893,"end_offset":916},{"id":18569,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":985,"end_offset":1010},{"id":18573,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1102,"end_offset":1132},{"id":18574,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1136,"end_offset":1159},{"id":18575,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1163,"end_offset":1191},{"id":18577,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1359,"end_offset":1387},{"id":18579,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1420,"end_offset":1451},{"id":18562,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":741,"end_offset":750},{"id":18564,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":772,"end_offset":789},{"id":18565,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":795,"end_offset":807},{"id":18568,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":966,"end_offset":981},{"id":18571,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1014,"end_offset":1035},{"id":18572,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1037,"end_offset":1058},{"id":18576,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1328,"end_offset":1355},{"id":18578,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1391,"end_offset":1416}],"relations":[{"id":9066,"from_id":18549,"to_id":18571,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9068,"from_id":18549,"to_id":18575,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9063,"from_id":18549,"to_id":18567,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9064,"from_id":18549,"to_id":18568,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9065,"from_id":18549,"to_id":18569,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9067,"from_id":18549,"to_id":18574,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9060,"from_id":18550,"to_id":18551,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9069,"from_id":18549,"to_id":18576,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9070,"from_id":18549,"to_id":18577,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9061,"from_id":18549,"to_id":18553,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9071,"from_id":18549,"to_id":18578,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9072,"from_id":18549,"to_id":18579,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1309,"text":"#Diagnosis - Keratoglobus - LA11.1\nDifferential diagnosis: Keratoconus: Keratoconus develops around puberty and may progress until 40–50 years of age, whereas keratoglobus presents at birth. Keratoglobus is considered a non-progressive or minimally progressive disorder. The corneal thinning in keratoconus is most commonly seen in the inferior paracentral aspect of the cornea. The protrusion is commonly described as conical in shape, with maximal thinning at the apex. Keratoglobus presents with diffuse thinning and a globular protrusion. Keratoconus shows scarring, Vogt’s striae and Fleischer’s ring. Pellucid marginal degeneration: Pellucid marginal degeneration presents around 20–40 years of age. Thinning involves the inferior aspect of cornea, as a band of 1–2 mm width and extending from 4 to 8 o’clock position. Protrusion occur superior to this area of thinning, leading to characteristic topographical patterns. Scarring and hydrops may also occur as well. Congenital glaucoma: Congenital glaucoma may show moderate protrusion of the cornea, hydrops, and mild astigmatism with myopia. Hallmark of Congenital glaucoma is raised intraocular pressure and possible glaucomatous optic nerve changes that would be absent in the case of keratoglobus. There is no corneal thinning and corneal diameters may be increased. In congenital glaucoma, the myopia would result primarily from the increased anterior and posterior axial length, whereas in keratoglobus it would be mainly because of the increased corneal curvature. Megalocornea: In megalocornea, the main differentiating feature is the increased corneal diameter (usually over 12.5 mm) with absence of any corneal thinning. This is in contrast to keratoglobus where corneal diameters are normal and there is profound, diffuse thinning. There is therefore an absence of any corneal protrusion, astigmatism, hydrops, or scarring in cases of megalocornea.

Enforcement of use of protective glasses is difficult in children, making them susceptible to injury. Medical therapy: Spectacle correction: High myopia may be corrected with spectacles, but is limited by high irregular astigmatism. Contact lenses: Use of contact lenses is still a matter of debate because of the theoretical risk of perforation on contact lens insertion and removal over corneas that are known to perforate on even trivial trauma. Surgical therapy: Surgically, there is no known standard procedure for management of the condition owing to its rarity. Individual procedures have their own advantages and disadvantages. Repair of perforations: Repair of perforations commonly resulted in poor outcomes because of the nature of the perforations that are usually large, and owing to the fragility of the thinned cornea that prevented stable placement of sutures that would cut through or ‘cheese-wire’.

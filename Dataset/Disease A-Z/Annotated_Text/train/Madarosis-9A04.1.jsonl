{"id":1430,"text":"#Overview - Madarosis - 9A04.1\nMadarosis is defined as the loss or absence of eyelashes (ciliary madarosis) or eyebrows (superciliary madarosis) or both. The term madarosis was originally coined to denote loss of eyelashes due to destruction of hair follicles. But now, this term encompasses loss of cilia either of eyelashes or eyebrows or both. Loss of eyelashes is also known as milphosis. Madarosis as a clinical sign has varied aetiology. This may be a manifestation of local or systemic diseases. Chronic blepharitis is one of the common causes of madarosis.

Management includes treatment of underlying aetiology. Cessation of the use of long term topical epinephrine therapy has shown re-growth of previously lost lashes. Similarly, treatment of blepharitis may prevent further loss of eyelashes. Therapy of malignant neoplasms causing madarosis is a priority and is more important than treating madarosis alone.

{"id":1071,"text":"#Overview - Gonorrhea - 1A7Z\nIt is a common human sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhea. It is most common in young adults. The bacteria that cause gonorrhea can infect the genital tract, mouth, or anus. Gonorrhea generally spreads during vaginal, oral, or anal sexual encounter with an infected partner. A pregnant woman can pass it to her baby during childbirth. The usual symptoms in men are burning with urination and penile discharge. Women, on the other hand, are asymptomatic half the time or have vaginal discharge and pelvic pain. In both men and women if gonorrhea is left untreated, it may spread locally causing epididymitis or pelvic inflammatory disease or throughout the body, affecting joints and heart valves.","entities":[{"id":15561,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":29,"end_offset":31},{"id":15562,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":161,"end_offset":173},{"id":15564,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":210,"end_offset":223},{"id":15565,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":225,"end_offset":230},{"id":15568,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":276,"end_offset":340},{"id":15569,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":342,"end_offset":358},{"id":15571,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":459,"end_offset":475},{"id":15577,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":677,"end_offset":704},{"id":15559,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":21},{"id":15560,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":95,"end_offset":124},{"id":15563,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":185,"end_offset":194},{"id":15566,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":235,"end_offset":239},{"id":15567,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":241,"end_offset":250},{"id":15570,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":432,"end_offset":454},{"id":15572,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":507,"end_offset":533},{"id":15573,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":542,"end_offset":559},{"id":15574,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":564,"end_offset":575},{"id":15575,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":602,"end_offset":611},{"id":15576,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":661,"end_offset":673},{"id":15578,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":708,"end_offset":762}],"relations":[{"id":7493,"from_id":15563,"to_id":15565,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":7494,"from_id":15563,"to_id":15566,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":7495,"from_id":15567,"to_id":15568,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7498,"from_id":15575,"to_id":15578,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":7491,"from_id":15561,"to_id":15560,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7492,"from_id":15563,"to_id":15564,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":7496,"from_id":15575,"to_id":15576,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":7497,"from_id":15575,"to_id":15577,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

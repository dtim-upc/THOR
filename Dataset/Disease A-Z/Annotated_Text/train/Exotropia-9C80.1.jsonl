{"id":620,"text":"#Overview - Exotropia - 9C80.1\nChildhood exotropia (outward deviation) is a horizontal exodeviation characterised by visual axis forming a divergent angle. It usually begins as exophoria. Exophoria is a condition in which eyes are straight without deviation when both eyes are open. However, eye under cover deviates on cover-uncover test or alternate cover test. It may progress to exotropia which may be latent (exophoria) or manifest (Exotropia). Fluctuation between phoria and tropia is common in exotropia. Classification of childhood exotropia: It is broadly classified as: Intermittent exotropia. Constant exotropia: Constant exotropia may be of following types: Congenital exotropia, Decompensated intermittent exotropia, Sensory deprivation exotropia, Consecutive exotropia.","entities":[{"id":10059,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":22},{"id":10060,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":31,"end_offset":50},{"id":10065,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":188,"end_offset":198},{"id":10070,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":530,"end_offset":549},{"id":10064,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":177,"end_offset":186},{"id":10067,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":383,"end_offset":393},{"id":10071,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":580,"end_offset":602},{"id":10072,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":604,"end_offset":622},{"id":10073,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":670,"end_offset":690},{"id":10074,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":692,"end_offset":728},{"id":10075,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":730,"end_offset":759},{"id":10076,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":761,"end_offset":782},{"id":10077,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":156,"end_offset":159}],"relations":[{"id":4637,"from_id":10077,"to_id":10064,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":621,"text":"#Diagnosis - Exotropia - 9C80.1\nFor diagnosis of childhood exotropia:- A complete eye examination is conducted including record of ocular motility. Intermittent exotropia: Patients with intermittent exotropia rarely have any complaints due to well developed suppression mechanism. Patient may have symptoms like eyestrain, headache, blurring of vision or difficulty in prolonged reading. Congenital Exotropia: It is characterised by:- Fairly large and constant angle of deviation. Infant has normal refraction. Adduction is not restricted. Decompensated intermittent exotropia: In some patients, exophoria progresses to intermittent exotropia that eventually may lead to constant exotropia. Sensory deprivation exotropia: An eye with poor vision (may be due to opaque media), or a blind eye drifts outwards into exodeviation. This usually occurs in children 2 to 4 years of age and in adults. Consecutive exotropia: Development of consecutive exotropia, after correction of esotropia, may take many years.","entities":[{"id":10086,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":148,"end_offset":170},{"id":10089,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":323,"end_offset":331},{"id":10098,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":540,"end_offset":576},{"id":10080,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":23},{"id":10082,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":49,"end_offset":68},{"id":10084,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":71,"end_offset":97},{"id":10088,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":312,"end_offset":321},{"id":10090,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":333,"end_offset":386},{"id":10093,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":388,"end_offset":408},{"id":10095,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":435,"end_offset":479},{"id":10096,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":481,"end_offset":509},{"id":10097,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":511,"end_offset":538},{"id":10101,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":691,"end_offset":720},{"id":10103,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":722,"end_offset":824},{"id":10106,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":893,"end_offset":914}],"relations":[{"id":4647,"from_id":10093,"to_id":10095,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":4648,"from_id":10101,"to_id":10103,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":4643,"from_id":10082,"to_id":10084,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Bacterial dacryoadenitis: Acute suppurative bacterial dacryoadenitis is less common. Fungal dacryoadenitis: It is rare and may be caused by: Histoplasmosis. Blastomycosis. Protozoal dacryoadenitis: It may rarely be caused by organisms like acanthamoeba. Idiopathic dacryoadenitis: Idiopathic is a nonspecific dacryoadenitis and is the most common histopathological diagnosis made for the lacrimal gland lesions. Autoimmune dacryoadenitis: The lacrimal gland is often affected by autoimmune disorders and may be the first or only presentation. Lymphoproliferative dacryoadenitis: Lymphoproliferative tumours may also cause orbital and lacrimal gland inflammation.

{"id":1169,"text":"#Overview - Dacryoadenitis - 1D80.Y\nDacryoadenitis is an inflammation of the lacrimal gland. Dacryoadenitis may be acute or chronic. Lacrimal gland is located in the superotemporal part of the orbit. It consists of two parts, palpebral lobe, which is visible on eversion of the eyelid and orbital lobe. Secretions of gland form the aqueous layer of the tear film. Dacryoadenitis may be infectious or has systemic aetiology. Lacrimal gland belongs to the lymphoid tissue system and is called mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). It contains Immunogobulin A (IgA) plasma cells, T cell lymphocytes and few B cell lymphocytes. Dacryoadenitis often lacks the inflammatory signs and may present with enlargement only, then it has to be distinguished from the neoplasm of the gland.","entities":[{"id":17150,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":57,"end_offset":91},{"id":17154,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":166,"end_offset":198},{"id":17155,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":226,"end_offset":240},{"id":17156,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":289,"end_offset":301},{"id":17158,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":386,"end_offset":397},{"id":17161,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":453,"end_offset":476},{"id":17162,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":491,"end_offset":531},{"id":17163,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":628,"end_offset":643},{"id":17157,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":364,"end_offset":379},{"id":17159,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":404,"end_offset":422},{"id":17160,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":424,"end_offset":438},{"id":17165,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":699,"end_offset":710},{"id":17166,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":758,"end_offset":779},{"id":17148,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":11,"end_offset":26},{"id":17149,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":36,"end_offset":51},{"id":17151,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":93,"end_offset":108},{"id":17152,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":115,"end_offset":131},{"id":17153,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":133,"end_offset":147}],"relations":[{"id":8323,"from_id":17163,"to_id":17165,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":8325,"from_id":17149,"to_id":17150,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":8326,"from_id":17157,"to_id":17158,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":8327,"from_id":17157,"to_id":17159,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":8324,"from_id":17151,"to_id":17152,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

# Résumé Datasets

## Evaluation Data
We used this dataset in order to evaluate the Generalizability of THOR (our approach) against SOTA models. This dataset was generated by collecting information related to Résumé of job-seekers. We randomly selected 270 resume from the original dataset and compiled 54 documents (each containing 5 CVs) from these resumes. The [**original dataset**](https://www.romanshilpakar.com.np/blog/6) is a collection of 1014 annotated resumes. This dataset extended the schema of the following **PAPER** in order to annotate the resumes.

#### Annotated Text Dataset (Disease A-Z) Statistics

| \#          | Training | Validation | Test | Total  |
|-------------|----------|------------|------|--------|
| Resume      | 100      | 70         | 100  | 270    |
| Documents   | 20       | 14         | 20   | 54     |
| Entities    | 1656     | 1463       | 2140 | 5259   |
| Tokens      | 41675    | 25389      | 38459| 105523 |

#### Statistics of Structured Data

We created a total of 12 CSV files (once for each concept in the dataset - see below the description of the dataset) containing only the **Entities** from the **training** and **validation** set of the annotated text. These entities in essence form the instances in our structured data sources whereas the concept name acts as the column name. 

| Sources | Concepts | Subject Instances | Instances |
|---------|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| 12      | 12       | 201               | 3119      |

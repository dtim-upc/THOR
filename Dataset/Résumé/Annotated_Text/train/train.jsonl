I got to contribute by writing numerous smart contracts,,researching cutting-edge developments in the field, and integrating best,practices for gas-optimisations, security-vulnerzbility assessments and utility,tools to the Smart Contracts. I'd also assist other internal teams (frontend and,backend) in integrating the smart contracts with the DApp.,My main takeaway from Ibriz was the extensive knowledge I obtained out of,building blockchain projects, most notably NFTs and Games from scratch to,production alongside a talented team.,iBriz.ai,Blockchain Developer,May 2020 - July 2020 (3 months),Education,Kathmandu University (KU),B.Sc., Computer Science \u00b7 (November 2017 - June 2022),Amarsingh Higher Secondary School, Pokhara,+2, Science \u00b7 (2015 - 2017),Gandaki Boarding School,SLC, Science \u00b7 (2008 - 2015),Page 2 of 2,\f, \u00a0 \u00a0,Contact,www.linkedin.com/in/zakariyah-d-a4b241162  (LinkedIn),Top Skills,Cloud Applications,Cloud Development,Network Architecture,Languages,Arabic  (Professional Working),Somali  (Native or Bilingual),English  (Native or Bilingual),Certifications,Cloud Architecture: Core Concepts,Cybersecurity Foundations,Learning REST APIs,CySA+ (CS0-001) Cert Prep: 5,Identity and Access Management,Learning PowerShell,Zakariyah D.,Cloud Engineer at HSBC,London Area, United Kingdom,Experience,HSBC,Cloud Engineer,April 2021\u00a0-\u00a0Present\u00a0 (1 year 4 months),FDM Group,Cloud Computing Consultant ,April 2020\u00a0-\u00a0Present\u00a0 (2 years 4 months),DWP Digital,USS User Access Admin,January 2021\u00a0-\u00a0March 2021\u00a0 (3 months),John Lewis & Partners,Selling partner,July 2018\u00a0-\u00a0April 2020\u00a0 (1 year 10 months),White city,Education,University of Westminster,International business with Arabic\u00a0 \u00a0\u00b7\u00a0(2016\u00a0-\u00a02019),\u00a0 Page 1 of 1", "entities": [[96, 112, "SKILLS"], [113, 122, "SKILLS"], [123, 126, "SKILLS"], [372, 387, "NAME"], [1090, 1100, "WORKED AS"], [1123, 1139, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [1162, 1182, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [1183, 1196, "WORKED AS"], [1218, 1234, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [1246, 1266, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [1267, 1281, "WORKED AS"], [1312, 1327, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [1358, 1371, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [1384, 1399, "WORKED AS"], [1425, 1433, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [1464, 1469, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [1470, 1492, "WORKED AS"], [1517, 1533, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [1864, 1879, "WORKED AS"], [1903, 1919, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [2176, 2190, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [2191, 2206, "WORKED AS"], [2235, 2243, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [2538, 2558, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [2559, 2584, "WORKED AS"], [2614, 2628, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [2769, 2796, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [2797, 2807, "WORKED AS"], [2839, 2847, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [3143, 3158, "WORKED AS"], [3181, 3187, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [3412, 3435, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [3436, 3455, "WORKED AS"], [3481, 3497, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [4886, 4901, "SKILLS"], [4928, 4937, "SKILLS"], [4995, 5002, "NAME"], [5125, 5137, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [5138, 5152, "WORKED AS"], [5175, 5190, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [5299, 5312, "NAME"], [5360, 5365, "LOCATION"], [5377, 5405, "LOCATION"], [5406, 5420, "WORKED AS"], [5446, 5463, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [5475, 5495, "UNIVERSITY"], [5496, 5531, "DEGREE"], [5635, 5645, "SKILLS"], [5646, 5654, "SKILLS"], [5655, 5665, "SKILLS"], [5724, 5739, "CERTIFICATION"], [6004, 6019, "NAME"], [6020, 6040, "SKILLS"], [6043, 6051, "SKILLS"], [6054, 6058, "SKILLS"], [6061, 6065, "SKILLS"], [6068, 6072, "SKILLS"], [6075, 6078, "SKILLS"], [6081, 6090, "SKILLS"], [6115, 6124, "LOCATION"], [6556, 6571, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [6572, 6585, "WORKED AS"], [6611, 6618, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [7379, 7394, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [8470, 8490, "WORKED AS"], [8513, 8521, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [8829, 8847, "SKILLS"], [8848, 8865, "SKILLS"], [8866, 8886, "SKILLS"], [9038, 9063, "CERTIFICATION"], [9064, 9082, "CERTIFICATION"], [9143, 9162, "CERTIFICATION"], [9163, 9174, "NAME"], [9238, 9242, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [9243, 9257, "WORKED AS"], [9281, 9296, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [9298, 9307, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [9308, 9334, "WORKED AS"], [9359, 9375, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [9377, 9388, "COMPANIES WORKED AT"], [9389, 9410, "WORKED AS"], [9439, 9447, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"], [9471, 9486, "WORKED AS"], [9512, 9528, "YEARS OF EXPERIENCE"]], "Comments": []}

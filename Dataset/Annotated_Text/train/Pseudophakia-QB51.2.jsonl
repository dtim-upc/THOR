{"id":1997,"text":"#Causes - Pseudophakia - QB51.2\nPseudophakia is the condition being produced by implantation of an intraocular lens in the eye. IOL: Design: Currently available IOLs are either biconvex, plano- convex or meniscus. Majority of implanted lenses are biconvex. In addition to minimising the effects of tilt, decentration and spherical aberration, a convex posterior surface of a biconvex lens may reduce the migration of lens epithelial cells which produces opacification of the posterior capsule. Positive meniscus lens is rarely used because when it is tilted or decentered, the induced astigmatism and power change is dramatic. A 10°- 15° tilt can induce enough regular and irregular astigmatism to make the spectacle correction intolerable. Edge design: Reflections, flashes and shimmering peripheral lights are related to the edge design. Most lenses had rounded edges to avoid reflected images. Optical transmission: After removal of crystalline lens, light with wavelengths of 300- 400 nm reaches to the retina. Ultraviolet light filtration is done in almost all IOLs to reduce blue light hazard to the eye. Material: IOLs are mainly made up of PMMA, silicone or acrylic. Silicone and acrylic lenses are foldable so that they can be implanted through small incisions (2.2 to 3.5 mm in length). Higher the refractive index, flatter is the curvatures of lens. Due to flatter curvature, acrylic lens is the thinnest of all. Special lenses: There are three special types of IOL viz. Multifocal, toric and aspheric. Multifocal IOLs produce an image that is about 30% reduced in contrast to mono-focal lenses. Toric IOL lenses are spherocylindrical glasses similar to spectacles. The magnitude of the cylinder in the IOL should be about 1.4 times the astigmatism in the cornea to neutralise corneal astigmatism completely. Aspheric IOL lenses are designed to minimise spherical aberration and to restore asphericity of eyes in young patients.

{"id":2001,"text":"#Overview - Pseudophakia - QB51.2\nPseudophakia refers to the presence of an intraocular lens (IOL) implant. The IOL may be inserted at the time of cataract surgery for the removal of crystalline lens or it may be put as a secondary procedure to correct aphakia. The IOL may be placed in the anterior chamber (anterior-chamber IOL) or posterior chamber (posterior-chamber IOL). Refractive power of the eye is determined predominantly by variables like power of the cornea, power of the crystalline lens, and axial length of the eyeball. In emmetropia, these three components of refractive power combine to produce normal refraction to the eye.","entities":[{"id":25824,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":34,"end_offset":46},{"id":25841,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":61,"end_offset":106},{"id":25847,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":401,"end_offset":404},{"id":25850,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":464,"end_offset":470},{"id":25853,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":638,"end_offset":641},{"id":25823,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":24}],"relations":[{"id":13242,"from_id":25824,"to_id":25841,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":2002,"text":"#Treatment - Pseudophakia - QB51.2\nUsually no management is required in pseudophakia. Pseudophakic patients may require correction of residual refractive power for distance, but only reading glasses may be needed. Management of any complication as and when required. Eliminating need for spectacles for both near and distance is an obtainable goal in many patients. Accommodative potential of either a pseudophakic or aphakic eye resulting in the combination of functional distance and near vision is described as pseudo- accommodation or apparent accommodation. Intraocular lenses designed to improve accommodative amplitude are divided into- Accommodating lenses: These are designed to dynamically move in the antero- posterior visual axis in response to ciliary body contraction and relaxation. Multifocal static lenses: These are designed to create multiple focal points for distance and near vision. Prognosis: Prognosis is usually good. There may be increased risk of retinal detachment, especially in high myopes and if posterior capsule is not intact.","entities":[{"id":25867,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":72,"end_offset":84},{"id":25880,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":120,"end_offset":172},{"id":25884,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":402,"end_offset":429},{"id":25889,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":757,"end_offset":769},{"id":25893,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":905,"end_offset":914},{"id":25866,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":25},{"id":25885,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":644,"end_offset":664},{"id":25886,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":563,"end_offset":581},{"id":25887,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":798,"end_offset":822},{"id":25894,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":916,"end_offset":925}],"relations":[{"id":13266,"from_id":25880,"to_id":25866,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":13274,"from_id":25886,"to_id":25866,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":13276,"from_id":25885,"to_id":25866,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":13280,"from_id":25887,"to_id":25866,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":13282,"from_id":25893,"to_id":25866,"type":"prescribed_for_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1632,"text":"#Overview - Leptospirosis - 1B91\nIt is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira and affects both humans as well as other animals. Leptospirosis is one of the world's most widespread diseases transmitted by animals to humans. In most of the cases, leptospirosis only causes mild flu-like symptoms, such as headache, chills and muscle pain. However, in some cases the infection is more severe and can cause life-threatening problems, including organ failure and internal bleeding.","entities":[{"id":21856,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":26},{"id":21858,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":71,"end_offset":103},{"id":21860,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":271,"end_offset":285},{"id":21861,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":297,"end_offset":361},{"id":21862,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":429,"end_offset":501},{"id":21857,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":42,"end_offset":60},{"id":21859,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":154,"end_offset":168},{"id":21863,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":386,"end_offset":414}],"relations":[{"id":10998,"from_id":21860,"to_id":21861,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":10997,"from_id":21857,"to_id":21858,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

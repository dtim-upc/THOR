Vector (living organisms that can transmit infectious diseases between humans or from animals to humans) - The common vector of CCHF is the member of Hyalomma genus, the family Ixodidae. These are hard ticks and suck blood from animals and humans. Both male and female ticks can act as a vector for disease transmission. Environmental factors: Ecological changes, poverty, social instability, poor health services, and absence of standard infection control practices have contributed to increased transmission of the CCHF virus.Mode of transmission: Animal to human transmission: CCHF virus may be transmitted to human either by bite of hard tick or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. Human to human transmission- Humans can become infected if blood, body fluids and wastes from patients with the disease comes into contact with broken skin or mucous membranes, as occurs when medical care personnel sustain accidental needle stick injury.","entities":[{"id":10617,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":42},{"id":10621,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":184,"end_offset":189},{"id":10622,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":375,"end_offset":380},{"id":10618,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":50,"end_offset":55},{"id":10619,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":67,"end_offset":122},{"id":10620,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":130,"end_offset":133},{"id":10623,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":397,"end_offset":432},{"id":10627,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":640,"end_offset":660},{"id":10628,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":666,"end_offset":713},{"id":10630,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":827,"end_offset":832},{"id":10631,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":866,"end_offset":989},{"id":10624,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":591,"end_offset":609},{"id":10625,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":611,"end_offset":618},{"id":10626,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":620,"end_offset":638},{"id":10629,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":764,"end_offset":769},{"id":10632,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1057,"end_offset":1166}],"relations":[{"id":4893,"from_id":10618,"to_id":10619,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4894,"from_id":10622,"to_id":10623,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4896,"from_id":10629,"to_id":10627,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4898,"from_id":10629,"to_id":10625,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4901,"from_id":10617,"to_id":10632,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4895,"from_id":10629,"to_id":10628,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4897,"from_id":10629,"to_id":10626,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4899,"from_id":10629,"to_id":10624,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4900,"from_id":10630,"to_id":10631,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

After two to four days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement). Other clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin.

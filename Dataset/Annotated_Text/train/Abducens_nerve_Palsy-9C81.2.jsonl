{"id":427,"text":"#Diagnosis - Abducens nerve Palsy - 9C81.2\nPatients with CN VI paresis present with esotropia (inward deviation) of the affected eye. Outward movement beyond primary position or midline is lost or reduced. Patients presenting with partial or mild palsy adopt posture with head turn toward the affected side to minimise diplopia by keeping the affected eye adducted (inward movement). Severe cases may shut the eye or cover it to avoid diplopia. Presentation depends upon the aetiology. Congenital CN VI palsy may present with congenital esotropia reported to occur about six to eight weeks of life. Most cases without peripheral misdirection of nerves are transient and probably are due to perinatal trauma. There are two types of transient CN VI palsy: Neonatal esotropia with an obvious unilateral abduction deficit, Neonatal esotropia with no obvious unilateral abduction deficit. Acquired CN VI palsy may be due to varied aetiology: Benign recurrent CN VI palsy in children may occur after benign acute viral sickness or immunisation. This is an isolated condition with acute onset, and is associated with restriction of abduction.","entities":[{"id":7646,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":231,"end_offset":266},{"id":7647,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":475,"end_offset":484},{"id":7648,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":486,"end_offset":508},{"id":7649,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":526,"end_offset":546},{"id":7653,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":754,"end_offset":817},{"id":7655,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":884,"end_offset":904},{"id":7658,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":994,"end_offset":1037},{"id":7643,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":33},{"id":7644,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":57,"end_offset":70},{"id":7645,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":84,"end_offset":93},{"id":7650,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":690,"end_offset":706},{"id":7651,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":731,"end_offset":752},{"id":7654,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":819,"end_offset":882},{"id":7656,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":926,"end_offset":935},{"id":7657,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":937,"end_offset":965}],"relations":[{"id":3352,"from_id":7644,"to_id":7645,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3353,"from_id":7648,"to_id":7649,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3354,"from_id":7651,"to_id":7653,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3355,"from_id":7651,"to_id":7654,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3356,"from_id":7657,"to_id":7658,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":429,"text":"#Overview - Abducens nerve Palsy - 9C81.2\nAbducens (or Abducent) nerve Palsy or Cranial nerve six palsy (CN VI) is a common neuro-ophthalmic disorder. Since CN VI has a long intracranial course, it may be affected by multiple aetiologies. It may be unilateral or bilateral condition. CN VI is a pure motor nerve that innervates ipsilateral (same side) lateral rectus muscle of the eye and controls abduction (outward movement) of the eyeball. This nerve has the longest intracranial course amongst all the cranial nerves. A palsy affecting this nerve alone is less common. Usually, seventh (CN VII or facial) and eighth (CN VIII or vestibulocochlear) cranial nerves are also affected along with it, which signals a central cause. Children are more likely to be affected by a tumour, and older people are more likely to have vasculopathy producing ischaemia. CN VI palsy may present with ‘false localising sign’, suggesting impingement, when in fact, the causative reason\/tumour may be remotely present, or there may not be any detectable reason\/tumour. Similarly, raised intracranial pressure may stretch CN VI, and perhaps compression of its vascular supply. The sixth cranial nerve is the most commonly affected motor nerve to the eye in adults.","entities":[{"id":7669,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":32},{"id":7670,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":42,"end_offset":76},{"id":7673,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":124,"end_offset":149},{"id":7671,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":80,"end_offset":111},{"id":7691,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":284,"end_offset":289},{"id":7693,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":443,"end_offset":453},{"id":7695,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":522,"end_offset":529},{"id":7698,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":695,"end_offset":697},{"id":7704,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":824,"end_offset":856},{"id":7706,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":858,"end_offset":869},{"id":7710,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1164,"end_offset":1183},{"id":7686,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":157,"end_offset":162},{"id":7688,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":226,"end_offset":237},{"id":7692,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":317,"end_offset":384},{"id":7694,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":506,"end_offset":520},{"id":7696,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":545,"end_offset":550},{"id":7697,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":582,"end_offset":665},{"id":7701,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":775,"end_offset":781},{"id":7709,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1105,"end_offset":1110},{"id":7712,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1233,"end_offset":1236}],"relations":[{"id":3371,"from_id":7698,"to_id":7697,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":3367,"from_id":7688,"to_id":7686,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":3369,"from_id":7695,"to_id":7696,"type":"influence_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":430,"text":"#Treatment - Abducens nerve Palsy - 9C81.2\nLike other cranial nerve palsies, root cause of palsy should be treated. Microvascular ischaemia\/vasculopathy secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension may lead to Isolated CN VI palsy. Observation. Patient should be observed for three to six months. Most cases resolve on their own within three to six months. Therapies vary from controlling vasculopathic risk factors to neurosurgical interventions. Medical therapy. Prismatic glasses: Cases of non-healing CN VI palsy may be prescribed with prismatic spectacles, and is most effective in cases with some preserved function of the nerve. Amblyopia therapy: Prescribed standard amblyopia therapy should be instituted. A small face turn adopted by children is beneficial and should be encouraged. Loss of head posture with esotropia indicates loss of fusion and probability of subsequent development of amblyopia. Surgical therapy. Muscle splitting surgery: Parts of superior and inferior rectus muscle are split and are attached to provide function of new abducting extraocular muscle. Unmanageable cases of complete CN VI palsy may be patched to avoid diplopia. Patching each eye alternately for a few hours each day, may be done to prevent amblyopia in the affected eye. Prognosis. Prognosis varies with aetiology. Cases due to vasculopathy usually resolve completely. Other CN VI cases have guarded prognosis. Patients are normally observed for six months for spontaneous resolution.","entities":[{"id":7716,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":54,"end_offset":75},{"id":7720,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":140,"end_offset":200},{"id":7721,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":222,"end_offset":233},{"id":7717,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":91,"end_offset":96},{"id":7719,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":116,"end_offset":139},{"id":7729,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":508,"end_offset":519},{"id":7732,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":543,"end_offset":563},{"id":7752,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1177,"end_offset":1180},{"id":7755,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1273,"end_offset":1282},{"id":7757,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1284,"end_offset":1293},{"id":7762,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1402,"end_offset":1411},{"id":7722,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":360,"end_offset":369},{"id":7725,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":392,"end_offset":418},{"id":7727,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":451,"end_offset":466},{"id":7728,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":468,"end_offset":485},{"id":7734,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":632,"end_offset":637},{"id":7735,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":639,"end_offset":656},{"id":7737,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":678,"end_offset":695},{"id":7739,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":822,"end_offset":831},{"id":7740,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":902,"end_offset":911},{"id":7742,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":931,"end_offset":955},{"id":7744,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":913,"end_offset":929},{"id":7746,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":966,"end_offset":1001},{"id":7748,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1117,"end_offset":1128},{"id":7751,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1153,"end_offset":1161},{"id":7714,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":33},{"id":7754,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1242,"end_offset":1251},{"id":7760,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1377,"end_offset":1388}],"relations":[{"id":3389,"from_id":7722,"to_id":7714,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":3390,"from_id":7727,"to_id":7714,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":3393,"from_id":7755,"to_id":7714,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":3375,"from_id":7721,"to_id":7719,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3376,"from_id":7721,"to_id":7720,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3381,"from_id":7732,"to_id":7729,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":3391,"from_id":7728,"to_id":7714,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":3392,"from_id":7735,"to_id":7714,"type":"prescribed_for_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1943,"text":"#Causes - Premenstrual syndrome - GA34.40\nThe definitive cause of PMS is unknown, however following etiologies are postulated based on recent research such as- Serotonin deficiency, because patients who are most affected by PMS have deficient serotonin levels; Magnesium and calcium deficiencies, as supplementation show improvement in physical and emotional symptoms. Exaggerated response to normal hormonal changes; although levels of estrogen and progesterone are similar to those of women without PMS. Abuse (emotional, sexual, or physical) in early life places women at higher risk for PMS in the middle-to-late reproductive years. PMS affects women with ovulatory cycles. Older adolescents tend to have more severe symptoms than younger adolescents do. Women in their fourth decade of life tend to be affected most severely.

The health care practitioner may ask the patient to keep accurate records or diary of symptoms throughout the next month or two. These records give the patient and health care professional a better understanding of the symptoms and how they relate to the patient's menstrual cycle.

{"id":1147,"text":"#Overview - Low Vision - 9D90.Y\nLow vision was defined as ‘Visual acuity of 6\/18 down to and including 3\/60 in the better eye’. A person with low vision is ‘someone who, after medical, surgical and\/or optical intervention, has a corrected visual acuity in the better eye of   <6\/18 down to and including light perception or a central visual field of   <20 degrees, but who uses or has the potential to use vision for the planning and\/or execution of a task.’ Thus, Low vision is a reduced level of vision that cannot be fully corrected with conventional glasses. In 10th revision of the International classification of the diseases, the term low vision is replaced by terms ‘moderate visual impairment’ and ‘severe visual impairment’, from all causes.","entities":[{"id":16509,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":22},{"id":16510,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":32,"end_offset":42},{"id":16511,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":122,"end_offset":125},{"id":16512,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":142,"end_offset":152},{"id":16513,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":465,"end_offset":475},{"id":16514,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":481,"end_offset":504},{"id":16515,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":541,"end_offset":561},{"id":16516,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":642,"end_offset":652},{"id":16517,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":675,"end_offset":701}],"relations":[{"id":8005,"from_id":16515,"to_id":16513,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":8004,"from_id":16513,"to_id":16514,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Stand Magnifiers: Stand Magnifier is a plus lens mounted on legs that fix the distance from the lens to object. Magnifying Reading Glasses: Magnifying reading glasses have plus lenses for short term use as a replacement, but cannot substitute the prescription glasses.  Spectacle Magnifiers:  Spectacle magnifiers are ideal for extended near tasks like reading or working on hobbies because they allow users to have hands free. Telescopes: Telescopes as vision aids, are ideal for tasks at any distance and for any duration of time. Technical  Magnifier: Technical magnifiers are ideal for extended near tasks such as inspection, quality control or viewing objects. Technical magnifiers may be hand-held magnifiers or stand magnifiers. Lamp Magnifiers: Lamp magnifiers sit on or clamp on to a table or desk and have illumination.

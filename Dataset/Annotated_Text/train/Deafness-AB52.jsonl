{"id":721,"text":"#Causes - Deafness - AB52\nThe causes of hearing loss and deafness can be either  congenital or  acquired Congenital causes Congenital causes leading to hearing loss include: Infections like maternal rubella, syphilis or certain other infections during pregnancy; Low birth weight; Birth asphyxia (lack of oxygen at the time of birth); Inappropriate use of ototoxic drugs (such as aminoglycosides, cytotoxic drugs, antimalarial drugs and diuretics) during pregnancy; Severe jaundice in the neonatal period, can damage nerve for hearing in a newborn infant, leading to defness. Acquired causes Acquired causes lead to hearing loss at any age. Infectious diseases such as meningitis, measles and mumps can lead to loss of hearing especially in childhood but can also occur in later life. Chronic ear infection, which commonly presents as discharging ears, can lead to hearing loss. In certain cases this condition can also lead to serious, life-threatening complications, such as brain abscess or meningitis. Collection of fluid in the ear (otitis media with effusion) can cause hearing loss. Use of ototoxic drugs at any age, such as antibiotic like Gentamicin or antimalarial medicines, can damage inner ear. Head injury or injury to the ear can cause hearing loss. Working in excessive noise or loud music or other loud noises, such as gunfire or explosions, can affect hearing. Age-related hearing loss (presbyacusis) is caused by degeneration of sensory cells. Wax or foreign bodies blocking the ear canal can cause hearing loss at any age.","entities":[{"id":11401,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":18},{"id":11402,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":40,"end_offset":52},{"id":11403,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":57,"end_offset":65},{"id":11404,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":105,"end_offset":122},{"id":11408,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":263,"end_offset":279},{"id":11409,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":281,"end_offset":333},{"id":11410,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":335,"end_offset":464},{"id":11411,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":466,"end_offset":504},{"id":11412,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":616,"end_offset":628},{"id":11413,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":669,"end_offset":679},{"id":11414,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":681,"end_offset":688},{"id":11416,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":785,"end_offset":806},{"id":11418,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1097,"end_offset":1111},{"id":11405,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":123,"end_offset":140},{"id":11407,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":174,"end_offset":261},{"id":11415,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":693,"end_offset":698},{"id":11417,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1006,"end_offset":1065},{"id":11419,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1148,"end_offset":1158},{"id":11420,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1162,"end_offset":1184},{"id":11422,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1223,"end_offset":1240},{"id":11424,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1295,"end_offset":1326},{"id":11426,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1463,"end_offset":1507},{"id":11429,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1391,"end_offset":1403},{"id":11421,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1208,"end_offset":1219},{"id":11423,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1265,"end_offset":1291},{"id":11425,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1432,"end_offset":1461},{"id":11427,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1518,"end_offset":1530}],"relations":[{"id":5346,"from_id":11403,"to_id":11404,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5347,"from_id":11427,"to_id":11426,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5349,"from_id":11401,"to_id":11407,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5351,"from_id":11401,"to_id":11409,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5352,"from_id":11401,"to_id":11410,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5357,"from_id":11401,"to_id":11417,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5359,"from_id":11401,"to_id":11419,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5360,"from_id":11401,"to_id":11420,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5361,"from_id":11401,"to_id":11421,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5363,"from_id":11401,"to_id":11423,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5348,"from_id":11429,"to_id":11425,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5350,"from_id":11401,"to_id":11408,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5353,"from_id":11401,"to_id":11411,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5354,"from_id":11401,"to_id":11413,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5355,"from_id":11401,"to_id":11414,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5356,"from_id":11401,"to_id":11415,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5358,"from_id":11401,"to_id":11418,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5362,"from_id":11401,"to_id":11422,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":5364,"from_id":11401,"to_id":11424,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":724,"text":"#Overview - Deafness - AB52\nAs per WHO, ‘A person who is not able to hear as well as someone with normal hearing – hearing thresholds of 25 decibel(a unit to measure intensity of sound) or better in both ears – is said to have hearing loss’.   Hearing impaired people can be hard of hearing (HOH) or deaf. ‘Hard of hearing’ refers to people with hearing loss ranging from mild to severe. They usually communicate through spoken language. If a person cannot hear at all, then they have deafness. They are unable to hear and understand even a shouted voice. Hearing impairment may be inherited, or caused by diseases like maternal rubella or complications at birth, certain infectious diseases such as  meningitis, use of ototoxic drugs(drugs toxic to ears), exposure to excessive noise and ageing.","entities":[{"id":11447,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":346,"end_offset":358},{"id":11448,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":485,"end_offset":493},{"id":11451,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":701,"end_offset":711},{"id":11440,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":20},{"id":11441,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":227,"end_offset":239},{"id":11444,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":275,"end_offset":296},{"id":11445,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":300,"end_offset":304},{"id":11446,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":307,"end_offset":322},{"id":11449,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":620,"end_offset":636},{"id":11450,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":640,"end_offset":662},{"id":11452,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":720,"end_offset":755},{"id":11453,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":757,"end_offset":795}],"relations":[{"id":5370,"from_id":11447,"to_id":11446,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

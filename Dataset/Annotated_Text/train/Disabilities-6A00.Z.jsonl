Disability is any continuing condition that restricts everyday activities. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) defines disability as an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. Impairment is a problem in body function or structure; an activity limitation is a difficulty encountered by an individual in executing a task or action; participation restriction is a problem experienced by an individual in involvement in life situations.","entities":[{"id":12013,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":34,"end_offset":44},{"id":12014,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":94,"end_offset":104},{"id":12015,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":209,"end_offset":223},{"id":12017,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":287,"end_offset":297},{"id":12018,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":331,"end_offset":360},{"id":12020,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":495,"end_offset":515},{"id":12022,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":411,"end_offset":421},{"id":12024,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":575,"end_offset":601},{"id":12012,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":24},{"id":12016,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":275,"end_offset":285},{"id":12019,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":461,"end_offset":493},{"id":12021,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":520,"end_offset":546},{"id":12023,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":548,"end_offset":558},{"id":12025,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":606,"end_offset":625},{"id":12026,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":702,"end_offset":727}],"relations":[{"id":5649,"from_id":12015,"to_id":12014,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":5651,"from_id":12022,"to_id":12019,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":5652,"from_id":12022,"to_id":12020,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":5653,"from_id":12022,"to_id":12021,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":5650,"from_id":12017,"to_id":12018,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":5654,"from_id":12023,"to_id":12024,"type":"influence_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1799,"text":"#Diagnosis - Osteoporosis - FB83.1Z\nOsteoporosis is often diagnosed after the weakening of the bones has led to a fracture. Diagnosis can be made on suspicion when patient approaches a doctor for any other reason or x-ray is done otherwise and bones appear weak. Conventional radiography: Conventional radiography is used either alone or in conjunction with CT or MRI, for detecting complications of osteopenia (reduced bone mass preosteoporosis). Dual-energy X-ray: Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis.

{"id":330,"text":"#Diagnosis - Atherosclerosis - BD40.Z\nPhysical Exam. Physical examination may show weak or absent pulse (e.g. in leg or foot). A weak or absent pulse can be a sign of   blocked artery. Diagnostic Tests. One or more tests may be required to diagnose atherosclerosis.  Extent of disease so determined by tests, helps in planning the treatment. Blood Tests. Blood tests check the levels of certain fats, cholesterol, sugar, and proteins in   blood. Abnormal levels may be a sign that you're at risk for atherosclerosis. ECG (Electrocardiogram). An ECG can show signs of heart damage caused by CHD. The test also can show signs of a previous or current heart attack. Chest x- Ray. A chest x- ray takes pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A chest x ray can reveal signs of heart failure. Ankle\/Brachial Index. This test compares the blood pressure in your ankle with the blood pressure in your arm to see how well your blood is flowing. This test can help diagnose P.A.D (Peripheral Arterial Disease). Other Tests. Other tests are being studied to see whether they can give a better view of plaque build up in the arteries. Examples of these tests include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET).","entities":[{"id":6031,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":28},{"id":6034,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":38,"end_offset":51},{"id":6035,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":53,"end_offset":73},{"id":6036,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":83,"end_offset":125},{"id":6038,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":127,"end_offset":149},{"id":6039,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":169,"end_offset":183},{"id":6040,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":185,"end_offset":201},{"id":6041,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":249,"end_offset":264},{"id":6042,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":240,"end_offset":248},{"id":6047,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":342,"end_offset":353},{"id":6048,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":355,"end_offset":366},{"id":6055,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":446,"end_offset":461},{"id":6056,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":500,"end_offset":515},{"id":6058,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":517,"end_offset":540},{"id":6060,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":545,"end_offset":548},{"id":6063,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":590,"end_offset":593},{"id":6062,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":567,"end_offset":579},{"id":6070,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":595,"end_offset":603},{"id":6075,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":649,"end_offset":661},{"id":6079,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":663,"end_offset":675},{"id":6081,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":677,"end_offset":691},{"id":6083,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":710,"end_offset":720},{"id":6084,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":725,"end_offset":753},{"id":6085,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":768,"end_offset":773},{"id":6086,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":775,"end_offset":780},{"id":6087,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":786,"end_offset":799},{"id":6091,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":801,"end_offset":814},{"id":6095,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":835,"end_offset":848},{"id":6098,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":850,"end_offset":870},{"id":6099,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":872,"end_offset":881},{"id":6100,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":918,"end_offset":923},{"id":6101,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":956,"end_offset":959},{"id":6102,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":999,"end_offset":1008},{"id":6103,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1027,"end_offset":1062},{"id":6104,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1064,"end_offset":1075},{"id":6106,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1077,"end_offset":1088},{"id":6109,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1153,"end_offset":1159},{"id":6111,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1176,"end_offset":1184},{"id":6112,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1197,"end_offset":1209},{"id":6113,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1218,"end_offset":1250},{"id":6115,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1255,"end_offset":1289}],"relations":[{"id":2495,"from_id":6031,"to_id":6035,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2496,"from_id":6041,"to_id":6042,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2497,"from_id":6031,"to_id":6040,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2498,"from_id":6031,"to_id":6047,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2501,"from_id":6056,"to_id":6055,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":2502,"from_id":6031,"to_id":6058,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2503,"from_id":6062,"to_id":6063,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2504,"from_id":6062,"to_id":6060,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2505,"from_id":6031,"to_id":6079,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2506,"from_id":6081,"to_id":6083,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":2507,"from_id":6081,"to_id":6084,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":2508,"from_id":6081,"to_id":6085,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":2509,"from_id":6081,"to_id":6086,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":2510,"from_id":6081,"to_id":6087,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":2511,"from_id":6031,"to_id":6091,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2512,"from_id":6095,"to_id":6091,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2515,"from_id":6031,"to_id":6098,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2516,"from_id":6099,"to_id":6100,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":2518,"from_id":6099,"to_id":6101,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":2521,"from_id":6103,"to_id":6102,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2524,"from_id":6031,"to_id":6104,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2525,"from_id":6106,"to_id":6111,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":2526,"from_id":6031,"to_id":6112,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2527,"from_id":6031,"to_id":6113,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":2528,"from_id":6031,"to_id":6115,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":334,"text":"#Symptoms - Atherosclerosis - BD40.Z\nAtherosclerosis usually doesn't cause signs and symptoms until it severely narrows or totally blocks an artery. Many people don't know they have the disease until they have a medical emergency, such as   heart attack or stroke. Some people may have signs and symptoms of the disease. Signs and symptoms will depend on which arteries are affected. Coronary Arteries The coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to   heart. If plaque narrows or blocks these arteries (a disease called coronary heart disease, or CHD), it may lead to   angina. Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when   heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. Carotid Arteries The carotid arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to   brain. If plaque narrows or blocks these arteries (a disease called carotid artery disease), one may have symptoms of   stroke. These symptoms may include: Sudden weakness, Paralysis (an inability to move) or numbness of the face, arms, or legs, especially on one side of the body, Confusion, Trouble speaking or understanding speech, Trouble seeing in one or both eyes, Difficulty in breathing, Dizziness, trouble walking, loss of balance or coordination, and unexplained falls, Loss of consciousness, Sudden and severe headache. Peripheral Arteries. Plaque also can build up in the major arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to the legs, arms, and pelvis (a disease called peripheral artery disease). Renal Arteries. The renal arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to   kidneys. If plaque builds up in these arteries, one may develop chronic kidney disease. Over time, chronic kidney disease causes a slow loss of kidney function.","entities":[{"id":6032,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":27},{"id":6033,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":37,"end_offset":52},{"id":6049,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":131,"end_offset":147},{"id":6050,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":182,"end_offset":193},{"id":6052,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":241,"end_offset":263},{"id":6059,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":361,"end_offset":369},{"id":6061,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":384,"end_offset":401},{"id":6064,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":406,"end_offset":423},{"id":6066,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":443,"end_offset":448},{"id":6067,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":454,"end_offset":459},{"id":6071,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":464,"end_offset":470},{"id":6072,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":482,"end_offset":503},{"id":6078,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":572,"end_offset":578},{"id":6080,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":580,"end_offset":586},{"id":6094,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":590,"end_offset":600},{"id":6096,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":634,"end_offset":646},{"id":6105,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":685,"end_offset":701},{"id":6118,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":763,"end_offset":769},{"id":6131,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":873,"end_offset":879},{"id":6140,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1035,"end_offset":1044},{"id":6116,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":706,"end_offset":722},{"id":6117,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":753,"end_offset":758},{"id":6126,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":781,"end_offset":802},{"id":6133,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":909,"end_offset":924},{"id":6134,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":926,"end_offset":958},{"id":6138,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":962,"end_offset":1033},{"id":6142,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1046,"end_offset":1086},{"id":6144,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1088,"end_offset":1122},{"id":6145,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1124,"end_offset":1147},{"id":6146,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1149,"end_offset":1158},{"id":6147,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1160,"end_offset":1175},{"id":6152,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1177,"end_offset":1208},{"id":6154,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1214,"end_offset":1231},{"id":6156,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1233,"end_offset":1254},{"id":6157,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1256,"end_offset":1282},{"id":6170,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1284,"end_offset":1303},{"id":6171,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1305,"end_offset":1311},{"id":6172,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1337,"end_offset":1351},{"id":6173,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1389,"end_offset":1393},{"id":6174,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1395,"end_offset":1399},{"id":6175,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1405,"end_offset":1411},{"id":6176,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1430,"end_offset":1455},{"id":6177,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1458,"end_offset":1472},{"id":6178,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1474,"end_offset":1492},{"id":6179,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1523,"end_offset":1530},{"id":6180,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1535,"end_offset":1541},{"id":6182,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1555,"end_offset":1569},{"id":6192,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1654,"end_offset":1682},{"id":6226,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":522,"end_offset":552},{"id":6234,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1587,"end_offset":1609},{"id":6235,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1622,"end_offset":1644}],"relations":[{"id":2499,"from_id":6050,"to_id":6052,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":2500,"from_id":6033,"to_id":6049,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":2539,"from_id":6032,"to_id":6133,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2540,"from_id":6032,"to_id":6134,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2541,"from_id":6032,"to_id":6138,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2547,"from_id":6032,"to_id":6140,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2548,"from_id":6032,"to_id":6142,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2549,"from_id":6032,"to_id":6144,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2551,"from_id":6032,"to_id":6145,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2554,"from_id":6032,"to_id":6146,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2556,"from_id":6032,"to_id":6147,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2557,"from_id":6032,"to_id":6152,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2560,"from_id":6032,"to_id":6157,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2558,"from_id":6032,"to_id":6154,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2559,"from_id":6032,"to_id":6156,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":2562,"from_id":6180,"to_id":6182,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":2563,"from_id":6171,"to_id":6172,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":2564,"from_id":6094,"to_id":6096,"type":"influence_R"}],"Comments":[]}

These factors include: Smoking, High amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood, High blood pressure, High amounts of sugar in the blood due to insulin resistance or diabetes.","entities":[{"id":6148,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":26},{"id":6149,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":110,"end_offset":126},{"id":6151,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":54,"end_offset":70},{"id":6153,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":213,"end_offset":229},{"id":6158,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":291,"end_offset":299},{"id":6159,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":324,"end_offset":331},{"id":6160,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":333,"end_offset":390},{"id":6161,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":392,"end_offset":411},{"id":6162,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":413,"end_offset":485}],"relations":[{"id":2550,"from_id":6148,"to_id":6159,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2552,"from_id":6148,"to_id":6160,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2553,"from_id":6148,"to_id":6161,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":2555,"from_id":6148,"to_id":6162,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":337,"text":"#Prevention - Atherosclerosis - BD40.Z\nTaking action to control risk factors can help prevent or delay atherosclerosis and   related diseases. Risk for atherosclerosis increases with the number of risk factors you have. Doctor may recommend medical advice along with heart-healthy lifestyle changes if you have atherosclerosis. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include heart-healthy eating, maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, physical activity and quitting smoking. Heart-Healthy Eating. Doctor may recommend heart-healthy eating, which   includes: Fat-free or low-fat dairy products, such as skimmed milk. Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and trout, about twice a week. Fruits, such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes. Maintaining a Healthy Weight. Maintaining a healthy weight is important for overall health and can lower   risk for coronary heart disease. Knowing   body mass index (BMI) helps in finding out   a healthy weight in relation to   height and give an estimate of   total body fat. Managing Stress. Learning how to manage stress, relax, and cope with problems can improve   emotional and physical health. Consider healthy stress-reducing activities, such as: A stress management program. Meditation. Physical activity. Relaxation therapy. Talking things out with friends or family. Physical Activity. Regular physical activity can lower many atherosclerosis risk factors, including LDL or “bad” cholesterol, high blood pressure, and excess weight. Physical activity also can lower   risk for diabetes and raise  HDL or “good” cholesterol, which helps prevent atherosclerosis.","entities":[{"id":6193,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":14,"end_offset":29},{"id":6194,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":103,"end_offset":118},{"id":6195,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1344,"end_offset":1361},{"id":6196,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":39,"end_offset":76},{"id":6197,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":152,"end_offset":167},{"id":6198,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":267,"end_offset":298},{"id":6199,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1371,"end_offset":1388},{"id":6200,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":311,"end_offset":326},{"id":6201,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1404,"end_offset":1419},{"id":6202,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":328,"end_offset":359},{"id":6204,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":368,"end_offset":388},{"id":6205,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":390,"end_offset":418},{"id":6206,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":420,"end_offset":435},{"id":6207,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":437,"end_offset":454},{"id":6209,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":459,"end_offset":475},{"id":6210,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1495,"end_offset":1508},{"id":6211,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1470,"end_offset":1489},{"id":6212,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1444,"end_offset":1468},{"id":6213,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":477,"end_offset":497},{"id":6214,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":520,"end_offset":540},{"id":6216,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1554,"end_offset":1562},{"id":6217,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":560,"end_offset":616},{"id":6218,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1510,"end_offset":1527},{"id":6219,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1621,"end_offset":1636},{"id":6220,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":618,"end_offset":703},{"id":6221,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1250,"end_offset":1260},{"id":6222,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1262,"end_offset":1279},{"id":6223,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1281,"end_offset":1299},{"id":6224,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":705,"end_offset":764},{"id":6225,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":766,"end_offset":794},{"id":6227,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":796,"end_offset":856},{"id":6228,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":882,"end_offset":904},{"id":6229,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":906,"end_offset":1042},{"id":6230,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1044,"end_offset":1059},{"id":6231,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1061,"end_offset":1165},{"id":6232,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1167,"end_offset":1248},{"id":6233,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":1301,"end_offset":1342}],"relations":[{"id":2572,"from_id":6194,"to_id":6196,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2574,"from_id":6200,"to_id":6198,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2575,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6202,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2576,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6204,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2577,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6205,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2578,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6206,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2579,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6207,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2580,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6209,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2581,"from_id":6201,"to_id":6212,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2582,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6213,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2583,"from_id":6201,"to_id":6211,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2584,"from_id":6201,"to_id":6210,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":2585,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6214,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2586,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6217,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2587,"from_id":6216,"to_id":6218,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2588,"from_id":6219,"to_id":6218,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2589,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6220,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2590,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6224,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2591,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6225,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2593,"from_id":6228,"to_id":6227,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2594,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6229,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2595,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6230,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2596,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6231,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2597,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6232,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2598,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6221,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2599,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6222,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2600,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6223,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2601,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6233,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":2602,"from_id":6193,"to_id":6195,"type":"has_precaution_R"}],"Comments":[]}

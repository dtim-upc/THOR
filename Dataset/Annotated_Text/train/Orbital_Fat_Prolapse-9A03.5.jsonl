{"id":1674,"text":"#Diagnosis - Orbital Fat Prolapse - 9A03.5\nDiagnosis is clinical. Orbital fat prolapse is seen most commonly supero-temporally where it protrudes beneath the palpebral lobe of lacrimal gland. It is seen as soft yellowish-white fat lobule beneath the bulbar conjunctiva, adjacent to lateral rectus muscle, or sometimes over it. Small lesions may not normally be visible and are seen only when the upper eyelid is pulled upwards. Thus, patient may not even be aware of its presence. Larger lesions may be visible within palpebral fissure. Very large lesions may lead to corneal dryness or may lead to Dellen formation. This condition may be unilateral or bilateral.","entities":[{"id":22498,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":599,"end_offset":615},{"id":22490,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":250,"end_offset":268},{"id":22492,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":327,"end_offset":340},{"id":22495,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":518,"end_offset":535},{"id":22496,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":536,"end_offset":555},{"id":22487,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":33},{"id":22488,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":66,"end_offset":86},{"id":22489,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":158,"end_offset":190},{"id":22491,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":290,"end_offset":303},{"id":22493,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":396,"end_offset":408},{"id":22494,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":481,"end_offset":495},{"id":22497,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":568,"end_offset":583}],"relations":[{"id":11361,"from_id":22488,"to_id":22489,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":11362,"from_id":22494,"to_id":22495,"type":"influence_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1676,"text":"#Overview - Orbital Fat Prolapse - 9A03.5\nOrbital fat prolapse is produced due to extrusion of intraconal (inside the extra-ocular muscle cone) orbital fat beneath the conjunctiva. Steatoblepharon is due to prolapse of orbital fat into the eyelids. It is a common finding and is generally related to the ageing process. The fat pockets present around the muscle cone in the orbits bulge forward behind the lax orbital septum. Orbital fat Prolapse is different from steatoblepharon and presents as a subconjunctival mass rather than a swelling of the eyelid. It may be unilateral or bilateral and is related to Eyelid surgery. Trauma. Generalised elastosis (cutis laxa). Idiopathic (most common). Orbital fat prolapse may protrude through dehiscence in Tenon’s capsule or may extend into the hood of Tenon’s capsule.

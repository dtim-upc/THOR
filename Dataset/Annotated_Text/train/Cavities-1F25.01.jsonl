{"id":692,"text":"#Overview - Cavities - 1F25.01\nCavities commonly called as “Tooth decay” is damage to the outer protective layer of the tooth such as enamel. It is the most prevalent chronic disease in both children and adults. Tooth Decay (Dental caries) happens when bacteria in mouth make acid that attacks the enamel. It can lead to cavities, which are holes in the teeth. If it is not treated well in time, it can cause pain, infection, and even tooth loss. In most developing low-income countries, the prevalence rate of dental caries is high and more than 90% of caries is untreated. An estimated 5 billion people worldwide suffer from dental caries.","entities":[{"id":11253,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":20},{"id":11254,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":31,"end_offset":39},{"id":11255,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":60,"end_offset":71},{"id":11256,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":120,"end_offset":125},{"id":11257,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":134,"end_offset":140},{"id":11258,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":157,"end_offset":182},{"id":11259,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":212,"end_offset":223},{"id":11260,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":265,"end_offset":270},{"id":11263,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":321,"end_offset":329},{"id":11265,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":409,"end_offset":413},{"id":11266,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":415,"end_offset":424},{"id":11267,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":435,"end_offset":445},{"id":11268,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":364,"end_offset":366},{"id":11269,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":142,"end_offset":144},{"id":11262,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":298,"end_offset":304},{"id":11264,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":354,"end_offset":359}],"relations":[{"id":5267,"from_id":11259,"to_id":11262,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":5270,"from_id":11268,"to_id":11266,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":5272,"from_id":11254,"to_id":11256,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":5268,"from_id":11263,"to_id":11264,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":5269,"from_id":11268,"to_id":11265,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":5271,"from_id":11254,"to_id":11257,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":5273,"from_id":11269,"to_id":11258,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":5274,"from_id":11268,"to_id":11267,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":694,"text":"#Treatment - Cavities - 1F25.01\nTreatment choice depends on the intensity of tooth decay. Early stages of tooth decay can be managed by fluoride treatment. Fluoride toothpaste strengthen the teeth and offer the best protection from tooth decay. Especially low dose toothpaste with 0.05% fluoride [often listed on the package as “500 ppm” (parts per million)] in it, is available for younger children. Toothpaste with 0.1% fluoride in it (more than 1000 ppm) is only recommended usually when the child is about six years old. If you have a cavity in your tooth, your dentist will clean the decayed tooth and then fill the tooth with a filling material. If the damage\/ infection of tooth has spread to the pulp (inside the tooth), then a root canal is required. In severe cases, when the damage to the tooth cannot be fixed, dentist may pull (extract) the tooth. Replacement of missing tooth is suggested after wound healing.","entities":[{"id":11283,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":106,"end_offset":117},{"id":11285,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":156,"end_offset":175},{"id":11286,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":191,"end_offset":196},{"id":11287,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":232,"end_offset":243},{"id":11281,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":21},{"id":11282,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":77,"end_offset":88},{"id":11284,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":136,"end_offset":154},{"id":11288,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":256,"end_offset":295},{"id":11289,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":401,"end_offset":411},{"id":11290,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":539,"end_offset":545},{"id":11291,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":554,"end_offset":559},{"id":11294,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":737,"end_offset":746},{"id":11295,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":800,"end_offset":805},{"id":11292,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":621,"end_offset":626},{"id":11293,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":704,"end_offset":708}],"relations":[{"id":5285,"from_id":11294,"to_id":11293,"type":"surgery_on_R"},{"id":5288,"from_id":11289,"to_id":11281,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":5289,"from_id":11294,"to_id":11281,"type":"surgery_for_R"},{"id":5283,"from_id":11285,"to_id":11287,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":5282,"from_id":11284,"to_id":11283,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":5284,"from_id":11290,"to_id":11291,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":5287,"from_id":11288,"to_id":11281,"type":"prescribed_for_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Clean between your teeth using floss or an interdental cleaner. Limit sugary snacks between meals and also limit added sugars and high-acid foods. Avoid foods that get stuck in grooves and pits of teeth or brush \/rinse soon after eating them. Rinse your mouth thoroughly after meals. Chew sugar-free gum with xylitol, which can promote salivary flow. Whenever possible, drink some tap water as public water supplies have added fluoride, which help in reducing tooth decay significantly.

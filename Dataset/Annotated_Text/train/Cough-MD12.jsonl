{"id":560,"text":"#Overview - Cough - MD12\nThe cough is a sudden and often repetitively occurring reflex which helps to clear the large breathing passages from secretions, irritants, foreign particles and microbes. The cough reflex consists of three phases: An inhalation. A forced exhalation against a closed glottis. A violent release of air from the lungs following the opening of the glottis, usually accompanied by a distinctive sound. Cough can be either voluntary or involuntary. Frequent coughing usually indicates the presence of a disease. Coughing can be due to respiratory tract infection and can also be triggered by: Choking. Smoking. Air pollution. Asthma. Gastro esophageal reflux disease(GERD). Post-nasal drip. Chronic bronchitis lung tumors. Heart failure and medications such as ACE inhibitors.","entities":[{"id":9360,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":17},{"id":9362,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":197,"end_offset":206},{"id":9363,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":292,"end_offset":299},{"id":9364,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":423,"end_offset":428},{"id":9368,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":613,"end_offset":620},{"id":9369,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":622,"end_offset":629},{"id":9370,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":631,"end_offset":644},{"id":9374,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":711,"end_offset":741},{"id":9375,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":781,"end_offset":795},{"id":9365,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":469,"end_offset":486},{"id":9367,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":532,"end_offset":540},{"id":9371,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":646,"end_offset":652},{"id":9372,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":654,"end_offset":692},{"id":9373,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":694,"end_offset":709},{"id":9361,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":25,"end_offset":34}],"relations":[{"id":4232,"from_id":9367,"to_id":9368,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4234,"from_id":9367,"to_id":9370,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4235,"from_id":9367,"to_id":9371,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4236,"from_id":9367,"to_id":9372,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4233,"from_id":9367,"to_id":9369,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4237,"from_id":9367,"to_id":9373,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4238,"from_id":9367,"to_id":9374,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1566,"text":"#Causes - Kala Azar - 1F54.0\nThere is only one sand fly vector of Kala-Azar in India i.e. Phlebotomus argentipes. Sand flies are small insects, about one fourth of the size of a mosquito. The length of a sand fly body ranges from 1.5 to 3.5 mm. Sand flies breed in high relative humidity, warm temperature, high subsoil water and abundance of vegetation. Sandflies breed in favourable micro-climatic conditions in places with high organic matter that serve as food for larvae. These are ecologically sensitive insects, fragile and cannot withstand desiccation.","entities":[{"id":21140,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":19},{"id":21141,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":66,"end_offset":75},{"id":21189,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":90,"end_offset":112}],"relations":[{"id":10584,"from_id":21141,"to_id":21189,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1569,"text":"#Prevention - Kala Azar - 1F54.0\nThere are no vaccines or preventive drugs for visceral leishmaniasis. The most effective method to prevent infection is to protect from sand fly bites. To decrease the risk of being bitten Following precautions are suggested: Outdoors: Avoid outdoor activities, especially from dusk to dawn, when sand flies generally are the most active. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin and under the ends of sleeves and pant legs. Indoors: Stay in well-screened or air-conditioned areas. Keep in mind that sand flies are much smaller than mosquitoes and therefore can get through smaller holes. Spray living\/sleeping areas with an insecticide to kill insects. If possible, use a bed net that has been soaked in or sprayed with a pyrethroid-containing insecticide.","entities":[{"id":21190,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":14,"end_offset":23},{"id":21191,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":79,"end_offset":101},{"id":21192,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":156,"end_offset":183},{"id":21194,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":372,"end_offset":454},{"id":21195,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":465,"end_offset":511},{"id":21193,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":269,"end_offset":370},{"id":21196,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":620,"end_offset":683},{"id":21197,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":698,"end_offset":787}],"relations":[{"id":10585,"from_id":21190,"to_id":21192,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":10590,"from_id":21190,"to_id":21197,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":10589,"from_id":21190,"to_id":21196,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":10588,"from_id":21190,"to_id":21195,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":10587,"from_id":21190,"to_id":21194,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":10586,"from_id":21190,"to_id":21193,"type":"has_precaution_R"}],"Comments":[]}

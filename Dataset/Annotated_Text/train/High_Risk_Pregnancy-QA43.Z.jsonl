{"id":1088,"text":"#Causes - High Risk Pregnancy - QA43.Z\nA pregnancy with high risk factor poses higher than normal risk for the pregnant women and fetus. Some common high risk conditions of pregnancy are: Maternal age: Early childbearing is a risk for both mother and new born. Advanced maternal age (defined as childbearing in a woman over 35 years of age) is reported to be associated with various pregnancy complications such as risk of stillbirth, foetal growth restriction, an increased risk of caesarean birth, premature birth, birth defects, multiple births, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, preeclampsia. Medical conditions that exist before pregnancy, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, sexually transmitted diseases or being HIV positive, kidney diseases, autoimmune diseases, thyroid diseases can present risks for the mother and\/or her unborn baby. Medical condition that occur during pregnancy may affect pregnancy and outcome such as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, placenta previa, polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios. Multiple births: The risk of complications is higher in women carrying more than one fetus (twins and higher-order multiples). Common complications include preeclampsia, premature labor, and preterm birth. Obesity: Being obese before pregnancy is associated with a number of risks for poor pregnancy outcomes. Alcohol, tobacco and substance use: Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can increase the baby’s risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs), sudden infant death syndrome, and other problems. Smoking during pregnancy may cause fetus at risk for preterm birth, birth defects, sudden infant death. Secondhand smoke also puts a woman and her developing fetus at increased risk for health problems. Zika infection: Infection with zika  just before and during pregnancy is a risk factor  for different problems with the brain and nervous system of fetus, pregnancy loss and stillbirth.","entities":[{"id":15753,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":39,"end_offset":72},{"id":15754,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":149,"end_offset":182},{"id":15757,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":435,"end_offset":460},{"id":15760,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":517,"end_offset":530},{"id":15761,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":532,"end_offset":547},{"id":15764,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":592,"end_offset":604},{"id":15766,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":383,"end_offset":406},{"id":15767,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":662,"end_offset":681},{"id":15752,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":29},{"id":15755,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":202,"end_offset":220},{"id":15756,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":423,"end_offset":433},{"id":15758,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":483,"end_offset":498},{"id":15759,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":500,"end_offset":515},{"id":15762,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":549,"end_offset":569},{"id":15763,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":571,"end_offset":590},{"id":15765,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":261,"end_offset":340},{"id":15768,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":683,"end_offset":691},{"id":15769,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":693,"end_offset":744},{"id":15772,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":784,"end_offset":800},{"id":15778,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1034,"end_offset":1049},{"id":15781,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1225,"end_offset":1238},{"id":15782,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1240,"end_offset":1247},{"id":15783,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1344,"end_offset":1378},{"id":15770,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":746,"end_offset":761},{"id":15771,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":763,"end_offset":782},{"id":15773,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":945,"end_offset":957},{"id":15774,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":959,"end_offset":979},{"id":15775,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":981,"end_offset":996},{"id":15776,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":998,"end_offset":1012},{"id":15777,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1017,"end_offset":1032},{"id":15779,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1190,"end_offset":1202},{"id":15780,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1204,"end_offset":1219},{"id":15784,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1447,"end_offset":1487},{"id":15785,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1489,"end_offset":1517},{"id":15788,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1607,"end_offset":1620},{"id":15793,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1872,"end_offset":1895},{"id":15795,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1916,"end_offset":1926},{"id":15786,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1539,"end_offset":1563},{"id":15787,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1592,"end_offset":1605},{"id":15789,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1622,"end_offset":1641},{"id":15790,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1643,"end_offset":1659},{"id":15791,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1742,"end_offset":1756},{"id":15792,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1858,"end_offset":1867},{"id":15794,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1897,"end_offset":1911}],"relations":[{"id":7603,"from_id":15752,"to_id":15767,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7604,"from_id":15752,"to_id":15768,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7605,"from_id":15752,"to_id":15769,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7610,"from_id":15752,"to_id":15782,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7606,"from_id":15752,"to_id":15770,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7607,"from_id":15752,"to_id":15771,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7608,"from_id":15752,"to_id":15772,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7609,"from_id":15752,"to_id":15778,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7611,"from_id":15752,"to_id":15783,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7602,"from_id":15752,"to_id":15765,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7612,"from_id":15752,"to_id":15786,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7613,"from_id":15752,"to_id":15790,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7614,"from_id":15752,"to_id":15791,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7601,"from_id":15754,"to_id":15755,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

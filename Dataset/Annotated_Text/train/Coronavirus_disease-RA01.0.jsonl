Molecular assays: 2019-nCoV can be diagnosed by molecular assays in samples from upper respiratory tract collected as nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and from lower respiratory tract by sputum (if possible for those patients with productive coughs) and or endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with more severe respiratory diseases. Serology tests: These are blood-based tests used to identify people who have been exposed to COVID-19 virus by looking at their immune response. These tests are used for surveillance purposes to know about the prevalence of a disease in a population by identifying individuals who have developed antibodies to the virus.","entities":[{"id":9949,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":32},{"id":9951,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":79,"end_offset":87},{"id":9955,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":220,"end_offset":236},{"id":9956,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":268,"end_offset":284},{"id":9958,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":392,"end_offset":409},{"id":9959,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":508,"end_offset":530},{"id":9961,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":553,"end_offset":580},{"id":9950,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":55,"end_offset":60},{"id":9952,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":99,"end_offset":157},{"id":9953,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":162,"end_offset":218},{"id":9954,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":238,"end_offset":247},{"id":9957,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":301,"end_offset":324},{"id":9960,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":483,"end_offset":504},{"id":9962,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":582,"end_offset":596},{"id":9963,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":608,"end_offset":625},{"id":9964,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":675,"end_offset":683},{"id":9965,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":728,"end_offset":738}],"relations":[{"id":4568,"from_id":9951,"to_id":9950,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4569,"from_id":9951,"to_id":9952,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4571,"from_id":9954,"to_id":9955,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4572,"from_id":9954,"to_id":9956,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4573,"from_id":9954,"to_id":9957,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":4570,"from_id":9951,"to_id":9953,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4574,"from_id":9954,"to_id":9960,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4575,"from_id":9954,"to_id":9959,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4577,"from_id":9964,"to_id":9962,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":4576,"from_id":9964,"to_id":9963,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Follow COVID appropriate behavior: When COVID-19 is spreading in the community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. To make your environment safe avoid the 3Cs: spaces that are Closed, Crowded, or involve Close contact. Prefer to meet people outside asoutdoor gatherings are safer than indoor ones. Virus vaccines: These vaccines use the virus itself in a weakened or inactivated form. There are two types of virus vaccines against coronavirus, weakened virus and inactivated virus vaccines. Viral-vector vaccines: In the development of these vaccines, a virus (such as adenovirus or measles) is used as vector or carrier and is genetically engineered to produce coronavirus proteins in the body, triggering protective immunity against it. The two types of viral-vector vaccines under development are replicating viral vector (can replicate within cells) and non-replicating viral vector (cannot replicate within cells). Nucleic-acid vaccines: Nucleic acid vaccines use genetic material from a disease-causing virus or bacterium (a pathogen) to stimulate protective immunity against it. The genetic material could be DNA or RNA.

On 7 January, Chinese authority identified a new type of coronavirus as a cause of pneumonia outbreak, which is different from any other human coronaviruses discovered so far. The new strain is named as 2019-nCoV. Afterwards on 11February 2020, this virus is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and disease is named as COVID-19 by World Health Organisation (WHO). To date, other six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified. Out of these, four are globally circulated in the human population and contribute to approximately one-third of common cold infections in humans. The other two viruses are Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS Coronavirus) causing severe respiratory diseases. Coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, are zoonotic, and can be transmitted from animals (civet cats and dromedary camels, respectively) to humans.","entities":[{"id":10005,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":241,"end_offset":250},{"id":10006,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":301,"end_offset":314},{"id":10007,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":361,"end_offset":370},{"id":10009,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":511,"end_offset":519},{"id":10003,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":31},{"id":10004,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":54,"end_offset":63},{"id":10008,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":426,"end_offset":486},{"id":10010,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":581,"end_offset":602},{"id":10011,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":744,"end_offset":759},{"id":10012,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":797,"end_offset":853},{"id":10015,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":930,"end_offset":957},{"id":10016,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":959,"end_offset":972},{"id":10019,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1000,"end_offset":1008},{"id":10020,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1014,"end_offset":1103},{"id":10014,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":858,"end_offset":921},{"id":10017,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":981,"end_offset":985},{"id":10018,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":990,"end_offset":994}],"relations":[{"id":4602,"from_id":10017,"to_id":10019,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":4603,"from_id":10018,"to_id":10019,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":4604,"from_id":10016,"to_id":10020,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":4606,"from_id":10018,"to_id":10020,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":4599,"from_id":10014,"to_id":10015,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":4601,"from_id":10016,"to_id":10019,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":4605,"from_id":10017,"to_id":10020,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"}],"Comments":[]}

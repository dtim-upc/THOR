{"id":1330,"text":"#Causes - Frost Bite - NE4Z\nFrostbite generally occurs when body is exposed to low temperatures. When the temperature is below freezing point, it leads to frostbite due to inadequate blood circulation to the exposed body parts. This can be due to the body's reaction to freezing by constricting circulation to the extremities so as to preserve its temperature and fight hypothermia. It can further lead to hypothermia (extreme cold, inadequate clothing, wet clothes, wind chill).  Poor circulation can also be due to other factors such as cramped positions, tight clothing, fatigue, certain medications, smoking, alcohol use, or diseases that affect the blood vessels such as diabetes.\n\n","entities":[{"id":18862,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":20},{"id":18863,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":28,"end_offset":38},{"id":18864,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":55,"end_offset":95},{"id":18866,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":155,"end_offset":165},{"id":18868,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":228,"end_offset":233},{"id":18870,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":383,"end_offset":386},{"id":18872,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":481,"end_offset":497},{"id":18873,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":510,"end_offset":684},{"id":18867,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":172,"end_offset":226},{"id":18869,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":240,"end_offset":325},{"id":18871,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":406,"end_offset":418}],"relations":[{"id":9227,"from_id":18863,"to_id":18864,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9228,"from_id":18866,"to_id":18867,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9229,"from_id":18868,"to_id":18869,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":9230,"from_id":18870,"to_id":18871,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Frostbite is most likely to happen in body parts that are far from the heart or those with large exposed areas to cold weather.

First degree: It is known as frost nip. It only affects the surface of   skin, which is exposed. Second degree:  If skin is exposed to cold for longer duration, then it may freeze and harden, but the deep tissues are generally not affected and remain soft and normal. Third and fourth degrees: If the exposed area freezes further, deep frostbite occurs.

{"id":671,"text":"#Causes - Chemical Injuries to the eyes - ND99.1\nMore than 25,000 chemical products with the potential to cause chemical eye injuries have been identified, many of which may be classified as acids or bases, oxidising or reducing agents, or corrosives. Acids and bases are the most frequently implicated chemical agents. The severity of the injury is related to the nature, concentration, quantity and pH of the chemical involved. Alkalis: Most common causes of alkali injury to the eye are lye, potassium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, lime, wet\/dry cement and ammonia. Ammonia (NH3): Ammonia (NH3) is available as a fertiliser and refrigerant, and is used in the manufacture of other chemicals. Ammonium hydroxide ranks high in severity in causing injuries to eyes. Lye: Lye, caustic soda or sodium hydroxide (NaOH), penetrates into the interior of the eye in 3-5 minutes. Solid sodium hydroxide, often used as a drain cleaner, can cause pressure to develop within the drainpipe, resulting in an explosion of lye into the face and eyes. Potassium hydroxide (KOH): Potassium hydroxide (KOH) or caustic potash penetrates the eye slightly less rapidly than sodium hydroxide.","entities":[{"id":10730,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":200,"end_offset":205},{"id":10733,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":240,"end_offset":250},{"id":10734,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":252,"end_offset":267},{"id":10743,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":562,"end_offset":569},{"id":10745,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":586,"end_offset":599},{"id":10746,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":697,"end_offset":715},{"id":10747,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":768,"end_offset":771},{"id":10728,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":39},{"id":10729,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":191,"end_offset":196},{"id":10731,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":207,"end_offset":216},{"id":10732,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":220,"end_offset":235},{"id":10736,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":430,"end_offset":437},{"id":10737,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":461,"end_offset":474},{"id":10738,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":490,"end_offset":493},{"id":10739,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":495,"end_offset":514},{"id":10740,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":516,"end_offset":535},{"id":10741,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":537,"end_offset":541},{"id":10742,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":543,"end_offset":557},{"id":10744,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":571,"end_offset":584},{"id":10748,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":773,"end_offset":776},{"id":10749,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":778,"end_offset":790},{"id":10750,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":794,"end_offset":817},{"id":10751,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":875,"end_offset":897},{"id":10752,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1039,"end_offset":1064},{"id":10753,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1066,"end_offset":1091},{"id":10754,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":112,"end_offset":133}],"relations":[{"id":4958,"from_id":10754,"to_id":10729,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4959,"from_id":10754,"to_id":10730,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4961,"from_id":10754,"to_id":10732,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4962,"from_id":10754,"to_id":10733,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4960,"from_id":10754,"to_id":10731,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4972,"from_id":10728,"to_id":10738,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4974,"from_id":10728,"to_id":10740,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4975,"from_id":10728,"to_id":10741,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4978,"from_id":10728,"to_id":10744,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4979,"from_id":10728,"to_id":10747,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4973,"from_id":10728,"to_id":10739,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4976,"from_id":10728,"to_id":10742,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4977,"from_id":10728,"to_id":10743,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4980,"from_id":10728,"to_id":10749,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4981,"from_id":10728,"to_id":10750,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4982,"from_id":10728,"to_id":10751,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":4983,"from_id":10728,"to_id":10752,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":673,"text":"#Overview - Chemical Injuries to the eyes - ND99.1\nChemical Injuries to the Eye constitutes an ophthalmic emergency, due to the potential for permanent visual impairment and threat to the structural integrity of the eye. Severe injury may result in widespread damage to the ocular surface epithelium. Chemical injuries cause tissue destruction created from a wave of strongly dissociated ions flooding the eyelid and\/or tear film and reservoir, penetrating the cornea and adjacent tissues, thereby reaching to the aqueous humour. Immediate shrinkage of the collagenous envelope of the eye results in a rapid rise in intraocular pressure, followed by a second rise which lasts longer and is produced by prostaglandin release. At any time, rise in pressure can occur due to clogging of the trabecular meshwork by necrotic debris, and from organisation of inflammatory components, followed by cicatricial closure of the chamber angle, especially inferiorly.","entities":[{"id":10798,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":41},{"id":10799,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":51,"end_offset":79},{"id":10802,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":128,"end_offset":169},{"id":10803,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":188,"end_offset":219},{"id":10804,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":274,"end_offset":299},{"id":10808,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":325,"end_offset":343},{"id":10811,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":406,"end_offset":412},{"id":10813,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":461,"end_offset":488},{"id":10807,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":301,"end_offset":318},{"id":10815,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":514,"end_offset":528},{"id":10818,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":530,"end_offset":636}],"relations":[{"id":5017,"from_id":10799,"to_id":10802,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":5019,"from_id":10799,"to_id":10803,"type":"affects_R"}],"Comments":[]}

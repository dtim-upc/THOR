Other preventive interventions may be recommended to boys and girls as appropriate are: education about safe sexual practices, including delayed start of sexual activity; promotion and provision of condoms for those already engaged in sexual activity; warnings about tobacco use, which often starts during adolescence, and which is an important risk factor for cervical and other cancers; and male circumcision.

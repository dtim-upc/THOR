{"id":464,"text":"#Overview - Bedsores - EH90.Z\nBedsores are also called pressure sores or pressure ulcers . Bedsores are injuries to skin and underlying tissues resulting from prolonged pressure on the skin. Bedsores generally develop on skin that covers bony areas of the body, such as heels, ankles, hips or buttocks. Most people at risk of bedsores are those with a medical condition, that limits their ability to change position, requires them to use a wheelchair or confines them to bed for prolonged periods. Bedsores can develop quickly and are often difficult to treat. Several care strategies can help prevent some bedsores and promote healing.","entities":[{"id":8714,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":55,"end_offset":69},{"id":8716,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":91,"end_offset":99},{"id":8719,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":191,"end_offset":199},{"id":8721,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":221,"end_offset":260},{"id":8722,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":270,"end_offset":275},{"id":8712,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":20},{"id":8713,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":30,"end_offset":38},{"id":8715,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":73,"end_offset":88},{"id":8717,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":104,"end_offset":143},{"id":8718,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":159,"end_offset":189},{"id":8723,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":277,"end_offset":283},{"id":8724,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":285,"end_offset":289},{"id":8725,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":293,"end_offset":301},{"id":8726,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":326,"end_offset":334},{"id":8728,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":498,"end_offset":506},{"id":8727,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":345,"end_offset":496},{"id":8729,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":607,"end_offset":615},{"id":8730,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":569,"end_offset":584}],"relations":[{"id":3859,"from_id":8716,"to_id":8717,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":3862,"from_id":8719,"to_id":8721,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":3863,"from_id":8719,"to_id":8722,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":3864,"from_id":8719,"to_id":8723,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":3860,"from_id":8726,"to_id":8727,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":3861,"from_id":8730,"to_id":8729,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":3865,"from_id":8719,"to_id":8724,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":3866,"from_id":8719,"to_id":8725,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":3867,"from_id":8716,"to_id":8718,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":465,"text":"#Prevention - Bedsores - EH90.Z\nThe best way to prevent bedsores is by changing position frequently to avoid constant pressure against body and to redistribute body weight. It also promotes  blood flow to the tissues. If one can't move, he or she should be helped to reposition at least every 2 hours, or every 15 minutes if you are seated in a chair. Pillows or foam wedges can help to shift weight if one is unable to move. Range of motion (exercise machine) exercises can help prevent contractures, improve circulation; and maintain joint integrity, mobility, and muscle mass.

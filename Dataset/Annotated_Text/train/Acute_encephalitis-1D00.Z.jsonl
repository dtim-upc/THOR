{"id":443,"text":"#Causes - Acute encephalitis syndrome - 1D00.Z\nAcute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) has a very complex etiology. Causative agents of AES include a wide variety of viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and non- infectious agents. While Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a leading cause of acute encephalitis syndrome in India (ranging from 5-35%), the etiology in a large number of cases however remains unidentified. In India during 2018, 15% of cases of AES were found positive for infection due to JEV. Herpes simplex virus, Influenza A virus, West Nile virus, Chandipura virus, mumps, measles, dengue, Parvovirus B4, enteroviruses and scrub typhus, S.pneumoniae are the other causes of AES in sporadic and outbreak cases in India. In many cases, however, no etiological agent is determined. Tick-borne encephalitis virus â€“ TBEV, Zika virus, Nipah virus are also found positive in AES cases. Some are the zoonotic disease, that transmitted from animals to humans via mosquitoes (e.g. Japanese encephalitis virus, and West Nile virus) or ticks, (Tick-borne encephalitis virus), while for other flaviviruses humans are the natural hosts; these include dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV).","entities":[{"id":7879,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":37},{"id":7880,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":47,"end_offset":80},{"id":7881,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":130,"end_offset":133},{"id":7882,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":100,"end_offset":108},{"id":7883,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":144,"end_offset":167},{"id":7884,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":169,"end_offset":177},{"id":7885,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":179,"end_offset":187},{"id":7886,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":189,"end_offset":194},{"id":7887,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":200,"end_offset":222},{"id":7888,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":230,"end_offset":263},{"id":7889,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":286,"end_offset":313},{"id":7890,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":453,"end_offset":456},{"id":7891,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":498,"end_offset":501},{"id":7892,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":503,"end_offset":523},{"id":7893,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":525,"end_offset":542},{"id":7894,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":543,"end_offset":559},{"id":7895,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":561,"end_offset":577},{"id":7896,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":579,"end_offset":584},{"id":7897,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":586,"end_offset":593},{"id":7898,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":595,"end_offset":601},{"id":7900,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":603,"end_offset":616},{"id":7901,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":618,"end_offset":632},{"id":7902,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":636,"end_offset":648},{"id":7903,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":650,"end_offset":662},{"id":7904,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":687,"end_offset":691},{"id":7905,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":792,"end_offset":828},{"id":7906,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":830,"end_offset":840},{"id":7907,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":842,"end_offset":853},{"id":7908,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":881,"end_offset":885},{"id":7909,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":905,"end_offset":921},{"id":7910,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":967,"end_offset":978},{"id":7911,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":984,"end_offset":1011},{"id":7912,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1017,"end_offset":1032},{"id":7913,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1037,"end_offset":1074},{"id":7914,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1150,"end_offset":1169},{"id":7915,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1175,"end_offset":1192}],"relations":[{"id":3472,"from_id":7889,"to_id":7888,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3473,"from_id":7890,"to_id":7891,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3474,"from_id":7904,"to_id":7903,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3475,"from_id":7904,"to_id":7902,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3476,"from_id":7904,"to_id":7901,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3477,"from_id":7904,"to_id":7900,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3478,"from_id":7904,"to_id":7898,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3479,"from_id":7904,"to_id":7897,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3480,"from_id":7904,"to_id":7896,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3481,"from_id":7904,"to_id":7895,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3482,"from_id":7904,"to_id":7894,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3483,"from_id":7904,"to_id":7893,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3484,"from_id":7904,"to_id":7892,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3485,"from_id":7908,"to_id":7907,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3486,"from_id":7908,"to_id":7906,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3487,"from_id":7908,"to_id":7905,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3488,"from_id":7909,"to_id":7910,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":3489,"from_id":7909,"to_id":7911,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":3490,"from_id":7909,"to_id":7912,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":3491,"from_id":7909,"to_id":7913,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":3492,"from_id":7880,"to_id":7882,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3493,"from_id":7881,"to_id":7883,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3494,"from_id":7881,"to_id":7885,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3495,"from_id":7881,"to_id":7884,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3496,"from_id":7881,"to_id":7886,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3497,"from_id":7881,"to_id":7887,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3498,"from_id":7909,"to_id":7914,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":3499,"from_id":7909,"to_id":7915,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

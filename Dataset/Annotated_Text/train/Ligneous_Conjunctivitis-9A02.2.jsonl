{"id":1123,"text":"#Causes - Ligneous Conjunctivitis - 9A02.2\nThere is evidence to support that ligneous conjunctivitis is the result of plasminogen deficiency. There are two types of plasminogen deficiency: Type I (hypo-plasminogenaemia) is a quantitative deficiency. Type II (dys-plasminogenaemia) is a qualitative deficiency. Type I deficiency is the type most associated with LC. With plasminogen deficiency, wound-healing capability is diminished and is most pronounced in mucous membranes, such as the conjunctiva. The impaired wound healing capacity causes an arrest of granulation tissue formation and excessive fibrin deposition. Due to the appearance, histopathology, clinical course, and response to treatment, it is also believed that LC results from an exaggerated inflammatory response to tissue injury. This injury may arise from infection or physical trauma, including surgery. Many cases of antecedent viral or bacterial infections have been described, including staphylococcal, streptococcal, and haemophilus conjunctivitis. In these cases, it appears that LC, in genetically susceptible individuals, develops as an abnormal response to the conjunctival trauma elicited by the infecting organisms. Trauma, especially from surgery, is also thought to be a cause of LC. LC appears to develop as an abnormal response of the immune system to the conjunctival trauma.","entities":[{"id":16191,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":33},{"id":16192,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":77,"end_offset":100},{"id":16205,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":826,"end_offset":854},{"id":16206,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":866,"end_offset":873},{"id":16207,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1056,"end_offset":1058},{"id":16211,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":1221,"end_offset":1228},{"id":16193,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":118,"end_offset":140},{"id":16195,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":189,"end_offset":219},{"id":16196,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":250,"end_offset":280},{"id":16208,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1140,"end_offset":1159},{"id":16209,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1186,"end_offset":1195},{"id":16210,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1197,"end_offset":1203},{"id":16194,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":165,"end_offset":187},{"id":16197,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":310,"end_offset":327},{"id":16198,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":361,"end_offset":363},{"id":16199,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":459,"end_offset":475},{"id":16212,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1263,"end_offset":1265},{"id":16213,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1267,"end_offset":1269},{"id":16215,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1341,"end_offset":1360},{"id":16200,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":489,"end_offset":500},{"id":16202,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":548,"end_offset":586},{"id":16214,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1295,"end_offset":1333},{"id":16201,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":370,"end_offset":392},{"id":16203,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":728,"end_offset":730},{"id":16204,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":747,"end_offset":797}],"relations":[{"id":7841,"from_id":16201,"to_id":16200,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":7845,"from_id":16207,"to_id":16208,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":7842,"from_id":16203,"to_id":16204,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7846,"from_id":16212,"to_id":16210,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7847,"from_id":16213,"to_id":16214,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":7835,"from_id":16192,"to_id":16193,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7836,"from_id":16191,"to_id":16194,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7837,"from_id":16191,"to_id":16195,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7838,"from_id":16191,"to_id":16196,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7839,"from_id":16198,"to_id":16197,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":7843,"from_id":16206,"to_id":16205,"type":"has_side_effect_R"},{"id":7848,"from_id":16213,"to_id":16215,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":7840,"from_id":16201,"to_id":16199,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":7844,"from_id":16208,"to_id":16209,"type":"influence_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1125,"text":"#Overview - Ligneous Conjunctivitis - 9A02.2\nLigneous conjunctivitis (LC) is a rare, potentially sight and even life-threatening (e.g. by airway obstruction) disorder characterised by recurrent, often bilateral fibrin-rich pseudo-membranous lesions of wood-like consistency that develop mainly on the tarsal conjunctiva. It is the main clinical manifestation of systemic plasminogen deficiency and typically presents in childhood. There appears to be a higher incidence in females as compared to males. With plasminogen deficiency, wound-healing capability is diminished and is most pronounced in mucous membranes, such as conjunctiva.  Plasminogen is converted to plasmin by plasminogen activators in the blood. Plasmin is a serine protease and is the predominant fibrinolytic enzyme in the human circulation, and is also found in the extracellular matrix. Plasmin plays an important role in haemostasis, as well as, is an integral component of wound healing (acts by degrading fibrin). Due to plasminogen deficiency, fibrin rich membranes or mucous strands accumulate, which on desiccation of the fibrin leads to the ligneous consistency of the conjunctival lesions. Episodes may be triggered by relatively minor trauma, surgery (done particularly for pterygium or pinguecula) or by systemic events such as fever and anti-fibrinolytic therapy. Similar mechanisms occur in extra-ocular manifestations of plasminogen deficiency.","entities":[{"id":16420,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":301,"end_offset":319},{"id":16421,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":201,"end_offset":248},{"id":16422,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":362,"end_offset":393},{"id":16426,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":597,"end_offset":613},{"id":16427,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":623,"end_offset":634},{"id":16429,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":836,"end_offset":856},{"id":16431,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":995,"end_offset":1017},{"id":16432,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1019,"end_offset":1040},{"id":16433,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1044,"end_offset":1058},{"id":16436,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1223,"end_offset":1230},{"id":16437,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1309,"end_offset":1314},{"id":16434,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1147,"end_offset":1167},{"id":16435,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1209,"end_offset":1221},{"id":16438,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1319,"end_offset":1344},{"id":16439,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1405,"end_offset":1427},{"id":16417,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":35},{"id":16418,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":45,"end_offset":73},{"id":16419,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":138,"end_offset":156},{"id":16423,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":453,"end_offset":501},{"id":16424,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":508,"end_offset":530},{"id":16425,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":532,"end_offset":570},{"id":16428,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":753,"end_offset":784}],"relations":[{"id":7955,"from_id":16431,"to_id":16432,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":7956,"from_id":16431,"to_id":16433,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":7949,"from_id":16418,"to_id":16419,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":7951,"from_id":16418,"to_id":16420,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":7952,"from_id":16424,"to_id":16425,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":7953,"from_id":16424,"to_id":16426,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":7954,"from_id":16424,"to_id":16427,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":7950,"from_id":16418,"to_id":16421,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Topical therapy including, topical hyaluronidase, heparin, azathioprine, alpha-chymotrypsin, sodium cromoglycate, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and fibrinolysin have shown limited success. Surgical therapy: Because trauma to the conjunctiva is likely to be an aetiological factor in LC, conjunctival surgery must be performed with utmost care. Amniotic membrane transplantation: Barbino and Rolando performed amniotic membrane transplantation for conjunctival reconstruction of LC.

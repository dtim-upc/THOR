{"id":1149,"text":"#Diagnosis - Lid Imbrication Syndrome - LA14.02\nDiagnosis of lid imbrication syndrome is primarily clinical. On physical examination of the eyes, the condition is best evaluated by having the patient tilt head back and then observing from beneath with a penlight whether the upper eyelid overrides the lower or not. Many patients have gelatinous thickening of the upper eyelid tarsal marginal conjunctiva. Vital staining: Topical rose bengal or lissamine green staining may be used to diagnose lid imbrications. These stain the tarsal conjunctiva along the upper eyelid margin. The severity of staining correlates to the severity of symptoms. In addition to upper eyelid laxity, some patients have concomitant lower eyelid laxity without ectropion.","entities":[{"id":16546,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":557,"end_offset":576},{"id":16535,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":37},{"id":16536,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":48,"end_offset":57},{"id":16537,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":61,"end_offset":85},{"id":16538,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":112,"end_offset":132},{"id":16539,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":140,"end_offset":144},{"id":16540,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":275,"end_offset":287},{"id":16543,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":406,"end_offset":420},{"id":16544,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":494,"end_offset":510},{"id":16545,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":528,"end_offset":546},{"id":16542,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":335,"end_offset":356},{"id":16541,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":364,"end_offset":404}],"relations":[{"id":8022,"from_id":16542,"to_id":16541,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":8023,"from_id":16544,"to_id":16543,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":8021,"from_id":16535,"to_id":16538,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":8020,"from_id":16538,"to_id":16539,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":8019,"from_id":16537,"to_id":16536,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1151,"text":"#Overview - Lid Imbrication Syndrome - LA14.02\nLid imbrication syndrome refers to abnormality of lid apposition in which upper eyelid overrides the lower eyelid. This causes lower eyelid lashes and keratinised epithelium to rub chronically against the upper eyelid marginal tarsal conjunctiva. This leads to keratinisation of the upper eyelid margin and metaplasia of the distal tarsal conjunctiva. The resulting abnormal distal superior palpebral surface, in turn, irritates the underlying corneal surface on blinking and prohibits normal replenishment of the tear film. There are symptoms of dryness due to poor tear film being produced by disruption in tear film mechanics. It may lead to persistent corneal epithelial defects.","entities":[{"id":16560,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":36},{"id":16564,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":174,"end_offset":193},{"id":16565,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":198,"end_offset":220},{"id":16566,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":252,"end_offset":292},{"id":16567,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":326,"end_offset":342},{"id":16569,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":594,"end_offset":601},{"id":16561,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":47,"end_offset":71},{"id":16562,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":82,"end_offset":111},{"id":16563,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":121,"end_offset":160},{"id":16568,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":354,"end_offset":397},{"id":16570,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":692,"end_offset":729}],"relations":[{"id":8029,"from_id":16561,"to_id":16563,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":8028,"from_id":16561,"to_id":16562,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

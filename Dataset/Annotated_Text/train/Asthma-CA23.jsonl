{"id":297,"text":"#Treatment - Asthma - CA23\nMedications: Medicines in asthma is generally given through the inhaled route. “Metered dose” and “dry powder” inhalers are equally effective for long term use, the “nebulized” form being generally used during acute attacks. Inhaling a drug is an effective way of taking an asthma medicine as it goes straight to the lungs, with very little ending up elsewhere in the body. There are two types of inhaled medications. Since asthma is an inflammatory disease, preventer medication should not be discontinued without medical advice. Airway-opening medication or Quick-Relief (Reliever) inhaler: The inhaler usually contains a short-acting beta 2-agonist. It works by relaxing the muscles surrounding the narrowed airways. Examples of reliever medicines include salbutamol, levo-salbutamol and terbutaline. They are utilized in stopping asthma attacks. Controller medication (Preventer) inhaler: It works to reduce the amount of inflammation and ‘twitchiness’ in the airways and prevent asthma attacks occurring. Examples of preventer inhalers are beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone and mometasone; often combination of these drugs with long-acting bronchodilators like salmeterol and formoterol are used as preventers to stop asthma attacks from starting and thus protect lung function.","entities":[{"id":5602,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":27,"end_offset":38},{"id":5603,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":40,"end_offset":49},{"id":5605,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":107,"end_offset":119},{"id":5609,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":126,"end_offset":136},{"id":5613,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":193,"end_offset":202},{"id":5615,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":237,"end_offset":250},{"id":5617,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":252,"end_offset":267},{"id":5622,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":308,"end_offset":316},{"id":5652,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1011,"end_offset":1025},{"id":5654,"label":"Composition_E","start_offset":1072,"end_offset":1086},{"id":5655,"label":"Composition_E","start_offset":1088,"end_offset":1098},{"id":5657,"label":"Composition_E","start_offset":1116,"end_offset":1126},{"id":5659,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1178,"end_offset":1193},{"id":5661,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1214,"end_offset":1224},{"id":5662,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1256,"end_offset":1270},{"id":5623,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":344,"end_offset":349},{"id":5631,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":451,"end_offset":457},{"id":5632,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":464,"end_offset":484},{"id":5634,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":486,"end_offset":506},{"id":5640,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":705,"end_offset":712},{"id":5641,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":759,"end_offset":777},{"id":5642,"label":"Composition_E","start_offset":786,"end_offset":796},{"id":5648,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":877,"end_offset":918},{"id":5649,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":920,"end_offset":922},{"id":5650,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":953,"end_offset":965},{"id":5656,"label":"Composition_E","start_offset":1100,"end_offset":1111},{"id":5653,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1049,"end_offset":1067},{"id":5658,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1149,"end_offset":1160},{"id":5660,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1199,"end_offset":1209},{"id":5601,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":19},{"id":5604,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":53,"end_offset":59},{"id":5620,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":301,"end_offset":307},{"id":5624,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":391,"end_offset":399},{"id":5627,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":424,"end_offset":443},{"id":5636,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":558,"end_offset":618},{"id":5637,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":620,"end_offset":630},{"id":5643,"label":"Composition_E","start_offset":798,"end_offset":813},{"id":5644,"label":"Composition_E","start_offset":818,"end_offset":829},{"id":5645,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":831,"end_offset":835},{"id":5647,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":861,"end_offset":875},{"id":5651,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":971,"end_offset":982}],"relations":[{"id":2275,"from_id":5602,"to_id":5604,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2277,"from_id":5613,"to_id":5601,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2278,"from_id":5605,"to_id":5601,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2279,"from_id":5609,"to_id":5601,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2280,"from_id":5617,"to_id":5620,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2281,"from_id":5622,"to_id":5620,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2282,"from_id":5627,"to_id":5601,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2283,"from_id":5634,"to_id":5631,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2284,"from_id":5631,"to_id":5632,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":2285,"from_id":5636,"to_id":5601,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2288,"from_id":5641,"to_id":5642,"type":"made_with_R"},{"id":2290,"from_id":5641,"to_id":5643,"type":"made_with_R"},{"id":2291,"from_id":5641,"to_id":5644,"type":"made_with_R"},{"id":2295,"from_id":5645,"to_id":5647,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2298,"from_id":5652,"to_id":5650,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":2299,"from_id":5652,"to_id":5651,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":2300,"from_id":5648,"to_id":5652,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2303,"from_id":5653,"to_id":5654,"type":"made_with_R"},{"id":2304,"from_id":5653,"to_id":5655,"type":"made_with_R"},{"id":2305,"from_id":5653,"to_id":5656,"type":"made_with_R"},{"id":2306,"from_id":5653,"to_id":5657,"type":"made_with_R"},{"id":2307,"from_id":5661,"to_id":5662,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2308,"from_id":5660,"to_id":5662,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2309,"from_id":5659,"to_id":5662,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":2310,"from_id":5658,"to_id":5662,"type":"prescribed_for_R"}],"Comments":[]}

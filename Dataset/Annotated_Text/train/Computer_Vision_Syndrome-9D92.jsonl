{"id":705,"text":"#Risk Factor - Computer Vision Syndrome - 9D92\nRisk factors for CVS include: I. Factors influencing surface disease: There are several factors that contribute to CVS and dry eye syndrome (DES). They include the following: Environmental factors: The cornea is very sensitive to drying and chemical imbalances from environmental factors such as dry air, ventilation fans, electrostatic build up, airborne paper dust, laser and photocopy toner, and building contaminants. Reduced blink rate: Most individuals blink normally 10- 15 times\/ minute. Studies have shown that the blink rate at the computer is significantly less. A reduced blink rate at the VDT contributes to a poor-quality tear film and temporary as well as long-term stress upon the cornea and ocular surface. This results in symptoms of DES. Duration of computer use: Longer duration of the computer work tends to result in long-lasting complaints that persist, even when the work is completed. Height and inclination of monitor: Increased odds ratio (eye strain) for certain eye symptoms is observed when the computer monitor is kept at about the eye level instead of below the eye level. Taking frequent breaks: Taking frequent breaks from computer use is shown to increase the efficiency because the breaks relax eye accommodative system, thus decreasing eye fatigue and headache. Distance of VDT from the eyes: Distance of VDT from the eyes is an important risk factor for CVS. Closer the VDT to the eyes, it is more difficult for the eyes to accommodate. Excess accommodation results in overwork on ciliary muscles which manifest as eye fatigue and headache. Increased exposure due to position of monitor: Normally reading of text on paper is done while looking downwards and it results in the eyelid covering a good deal of the front surface of the eye. This covering minimises the evaporation of tears. On the other hand, computer users look at their reading material in straight ahead gaze. Gender: The prevalence of DES is twice as frequent in females as compared to males. Age: Tear production normally decreases with age. Although DES can occur at any age in both men and women. Menopause: Hormonal changes have been identified as contributing to DES. Postmenopausal women represent the group of individuals affected most by DES.  Sometimes it is difficult to assess the relative contributions of menopause and ageing. Systemic diseases and disease syndromes: DES is associated with various systemic diseases. In the case of Sjӧgren’s syndrome, dry mouth and rheumatoid arthritis can assist in making the diagnosis. Several autoimmune diseases also have association with DES. Systemic medications: There are several systemic medications which contribute to ocular drying. Most prominent among them are diuretics, antihistamines, and anti-hypertensives. Spectacle wear: CVS with eye redness has significant association with the use of spectacles. Contact lens wear: Contact lens comfort is highly dependent on the fit of the lens and lubrication of the eye. If the eye is dry, the lenses dry easily and adhere to the upper eyelid during the blink. This ‘friction effect’ from DES produces discomfort. Cosmetics: Cosmetics may block the openings of the oil-secreting meibomian glands and create debris and inflammation. This leads to rapid evaporation of the water component of the tear film and deposition of foreign bodies from cosmetics in the tear film or on the ocular surface with resultant discomfort. Cholesterol: There may be statistically significant decreased prevalence of low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in patients with moderate to severe MGD.","entities":[{"id":11021,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":15,"end_offset":39},{"id":11023,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":162,"end_offset":165},{"id":11026,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":245,"end_offset":255},{"id":11027,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":343,"end_offset":350},{"id":11028,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":352,"end_offset":368},{"id":11029,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":370,"end_offset":392},{"id":11030,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":394,"end_offset":413},{"id":11031,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":415,"end_offset":440},{"id":11034,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":799,"end_offset":802},{"id":11036,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":804,"end_offset":828},{"id":11040,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1346,"end_offset":1375},{"id":11041,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1439,"end_offset":1442},{"id":11043,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1600,"end_offset":1624},{"id":11045,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":2045,"end_offset":2048},{"id":11048,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":2163,"end_offset":2179},{"id":11052,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":2498,"end_offset":2516},{"id":11022,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":64,"end_offset":67},{"id":11024,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":170,"end_offset":192},{"id":11025,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":222,"end_offset":243},{"id":11032,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":446,"end_offset":467},{"id":11033,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":469,"end_offset":487},{"id":11035,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":830,"end_offset":955},{"id":11037,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":957,"end_offset":990},{"id":11038,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":992,"end_offset":1025},{"id":11042,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1566,"end_offset":1581},{"id":11044,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1626,"end_offset":1671},{"id":11046,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":1961,"end_offset":1967},{"id":11047,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":2152,"end_offset":2161},{"id":11049,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":2220,"end_offset":2223},{"id":11050,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":2298,"end_offset":2301},{"id":11051,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":2433,"end_offset":2436},{"id":11053,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":2518,"end_offset":2552},{"id":11055,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":2649,"end_offset":2669},{"id":11056,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":2730,"end_offset":2743},{"id":11057,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":2775,"end_offset":2784},{"id":11060,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":3173,"end_offset":3182},{"id":11061,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":3480,"end_offset":3491},{"id":11054,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":2644,"end_offset":2647},{"id":11058,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":2786,"end_offset":2800},{"id":11059,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":2806,"end_offset":2824}],"relations":[{"id":5155,"from_id":11041,"to_id":11040,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5156,"from_id":11049,"to_id":11048,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5157,"from_id":11049,"to_id":11047,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5162,"from_id":11021,"to_id":11029,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5164,"from_id":11021,"to_id":11031,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5165,"from_id":11021,"to_id":11032,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5166,"from_id":11021,"to_id":11033,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5167,"from_id":11021,"to_id":11036,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5168,"from_id":11021,"to_id":11035,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5169,"from_id":11021,"to_id":11037,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5172,"from_id":11021,"to_id":11046,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5175,"from_id":11021,"to_id":11061,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5159,"from_id":11021,"to_id":11025,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5160,"from_id":11021,"to_id":11027,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5161,"from_id":11021,"to_id":11028,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5163,"from_id":11021,"to_id":11030,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5170,"from_id":11021,"to_id":11038,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5171,"from_id":11021,"to_id":11044,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5173,"from_id":11021,"to_id":11045,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":5174,"from_id":11021,"to_id":11060,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":707,"text":"#Overview - Computer Vision Syndrome - 9D92\nComputer vision syndrome (CVS), also referred to as digital eye strain, describes eye and vision-related problems that result from prolonged computer, tablet, e-reader and cell phone use. Many individuals experience eye discomfort and vision problems when viewing digital screens. The level of discomfort appears to increase with the amount of digital screen use. The main visual symptoms reported by visual display terminal (VDT) users include eyestrain, tired eyes, irritation, burning sensation, redness, blurred vision, and double vision, thus termed the phrase ‘computer vision syndrome’ (CVS). Vision problems and symptoms associated with the use of the eyes are the most frequently occurring health problems among VDT users.

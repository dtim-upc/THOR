{"id":591,"text":"#Overview - Bleeding Gums - MD80.Y\nBleeding from gums may occur while brushing or sometimes it occurs on its own (spontaneously). If you often see a pink tinge in the sink after brushing teeth, you have bleeding gums. It may be a sign of inflammation of gums. Inflamed gums appear red and swollen while healthy gums are light pink in colour. Most common cause of bleeding gums is accumulation of plaque on the teeth. If this plaque is not removed by regular brushing and flossing between teeth, it hardens up and turn into tartar or calculus which cannot be cleaned by regular brushing. Calculus can only be removed by professional dental cleaning by a dentist or dental hygienist. If not cleaned, over the time, it will lead to inflamed gums and increased bleeding from gums which is the main sign of gingivitis.","entities":[{"id":9602,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":25},{"id":9603,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":35,"end_offset":53},{"id":9604,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":203,"end_offset":216},{"id":9605,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":149,"end_offset":192},{"id":9606,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":238,"end_offset":251},{"id":9610,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":380,"end_offset":415},{"id":9611,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":425,"end_offset":432},{"id":9607,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":254,"end_offset":258},{"id":9608,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":260,"end_offset":273},{"id":9609,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":363,"end_offset":376},{"id":9612,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":523,"end_offset":541},{"id":9613,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":587,"end_offset":596},{"id":9614,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":729,"end_offset":742}],"relations":[{"id":4363,"from_id":9604,"to_id":9605,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":4364,"from_id":9606,"to_id":9607,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":4365,"from_id":9609,"to_id":9610,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":592,"text":"#Treatment - Bleeding Gums - MD80.Y\nIf you donâ€™t brush and floss properly and regularly, then do so: Brush your teeth twice a day and floss once a day. Use an extra-soft or soft-bristled toothbrush for brushing your teeth. Learn proper brushing technique and how to clean between your teeth from your dentist. Plaque forms very quickly and if it is not removed, inflammation of the gums start within few days, but good oral hygiene practices can help to remove it. Plaque harden to form tartar or calculus, further promoting bacterial growth. If tartar is present, get it removed by the dentist. The earlier it is detected, sooner it can be managed. Health conditions like diabetes are often associated with gum disease as well. Some medications such as antiseizure drugs or blood pressure drugs also affect your gums. The gums also are very sensitive to hormonal changes, that occur during puberty and pregnancy. It is important for pregnant women to see their dentist. Besides being part of prevention, oral hygiene is also important in the treatment of gingivitis and periodontitis.","entities":[{"id":9615,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":26},{"id":9618,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":310,"end_offset":317},{"id":9626,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":673,"end_offset":682},{"id":9633,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":775,"end_offset":795},{"id":9638,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":813,"end_offset":817},{"id":9639,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":823,"end_offset":828},{"id":9616,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":101,"end_offset":150},{"id":9617,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":152,"end_offset":221},{"id":9619,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":362,"end_offset":375},{"id":9620,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":382,"end_offset":387},{"id":9621,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":465,"end_offset":472},{"id":9624,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":546,"end_offset":553},{"id":9632,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":754,"end_offset":771},{"id":9646,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":1005,"end_offset":1017}],"relations":[{"id":4373,"from_id":9616,"to_id":9615,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":4376,"from_id":9617,"to_id":9615,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":4380,"from_id":9646,"to_id":9615,"type":"prescribed_for_R"}],"Comments":[]}

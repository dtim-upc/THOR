Isolation of virus from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is diagnostic, but is rarely accomplished. If poliovirus is isolated from a person with acute flaccid paralysis, it must be tested further, using oligonucleotide mapping (fingerprinting) or genomic sequencing, to determine if the virus is “wild type” (that is, the virus that causes polio disease) or vaccine type (virus that could derive from a vaccine strain). Serology Neutralizing antibodies appear early and may be at high levels by the time the patient is hospitalized; therefore, a four fold rise in antibody titer may not be demonstrated.

There are two types of vaccine that protect against polio: Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV). IPV, is given as an injection in the leg or arm, depending on patient's age. Polio vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Most people should get polio vaccine when they are children. Children get 4 doses of IPV, at these ages: 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months, and booster dose at 4-6 years. OPV consists of a mixture of live, attenuated (weakened) poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types. Under the pulse polio immunization programme, all children below the age of 5 years are administered two doses of the oral polio vaccine per year. The oral polio vaccine is administered in the program, since it not only protects the child, but also gets disseminated to the community, thus resulting in widespread protection.","entities":[{"id":22657,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":14,"end_offset":27},{"id":22658,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":79,"end_offset":90},{"id":22662,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":330,"end_offset":333},{"id":22664,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":370,"end_offset":383},{"id":22666,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":518,"end_offset":521},{"id":22668,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":827,"end_offset":845},{"id":22659,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":231,"end_offset":262},{"id":22660,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":267,"end_offset":291},{"id":22661,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":293,"end_offset":296},{"id":22663,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":337,"end_offset":340},{"id":22665,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":456,"end_offset":469},{"id":22667,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":602,"end_offset":605},{"id":22669,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":860,"end_offset":878}],"relations":[{"id":11427,"from_id":22657,"to_id":22658,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":11428,"from_id":22657,"to_id":22659,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":11429,"from_id":22657,"to_id":22660,"type":"has_precaution_R"}],"Comments":[]}

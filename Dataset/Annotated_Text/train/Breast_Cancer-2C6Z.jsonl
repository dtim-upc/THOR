Imaging: Mammography and breast ultrasound scan are also used to diagnose the breast cancer. Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts. The image produced will show any lumps or abnormalities present in your breasts. Your doctor may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to know whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid. Microscopic analysis: A biopsy is generally done when mammograms and other imaging tests, or the physical exam finds a breast change (or abnormality) that is possibly cancer. A biopsy is the only way to tell if cancer is really present.","entities":[{"id":8383,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":34,"end_offset":56},{"id":8384,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":180,"end_offset":187},{"id":8386,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":96,"end_offset":138},{"id":8387,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":189,"end_offset":227},{"id":8385,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":577,"end_offset":597},{"id":8388,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":258,"end_offset":271},{"id":8389,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":273,"end_offset":284},{"id":8390,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":358,"end_offset":365},{"id":8391,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":400,"end_offset":422},{"id":8394,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":631,"end_offset":642},{"id":8395,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":674,"end_offset":687},{"id":8396,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":744,"end_offset":750},{"id":8397,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":788,"end_offset":795},{"id":8392,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":439,"end_offset":446},{"id":8393,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":479,"end_offset":496},{"id":8382,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":26}],"relations":[{"id":3722,"from_id":8382,"to_id":8383,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3726,"from_id":8382,"to_id":8389,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3729,"from_id":8382,"to_id":8385,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3731,"from_id":8382,"to_id":8395,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3723,"from_id":8382,"to_id":8384,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3725,"from_id":8388,"to_id":8387,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3727,"from_id":8389,"to_id":8390,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":3728,"from_id":8382,"to_id":8393,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":3730,"from_id":8382,"to_id":8394,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Regular exercise and healthy diet is recommended for all the women of all age groups. Women who breastfeed their children are less likely to develop breast cancer than those who do not. The reasons are still not fully understood, but it could be due to the fact that women do not ovulate as regularly while they are breastfeeding and estrogen levels remain stable. Breast self-Examination (BSE) is a routine examination that should be carried out at the same time each month to physically check for any lumps or other changes.

This may happen due to early start of periods and late menopause. Family history: If there is a history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer in the family, there may be higher risk of developing breast cancer. Particular genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, can increase the risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer.

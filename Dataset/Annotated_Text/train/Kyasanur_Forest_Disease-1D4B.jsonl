{"id":1116,"text":"#Overview - Kyasanur Forest Disease - 1D4B\nKyasanur forest disease (KFD) is a tick-borne viral haemorrhagic fever endemic (constant presence of disease) in Karnataka State, India. It is also referred as monkey fever by local people. The virus causing the disease: KFD virus (KFDV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus and family Flaviviridae. KFDV was first identified in 1957, when an illness occurred in monkeys (the black faced langur and the red faced bonnet monkey) in Kyasanur Forest area of Shimoga district, Karnataka State along with febrile illness and few deaths in humans in neighborhood area (Sagar taluk of Shimoga district). Initially the disease was limited to three taluks (Sagar, Shikaripur and Sorab) of the Shimoga district of Karnataka. In subsequent years disease spread to Uttar Kannada, Udupi, Mangalore (Dakshina Kannada) and Chikmagalure districts of Karnataka. During 2012-2013, disease was reported from new districts and new states in India: Chamarajanagar district, Karnataka State; Waynad and Malappuram districts, Kerala State and Nilgiri district, Tamilnadu State. In 2013, an outbreak of KFD occurred in Bandipur Tiger Reserve Forest, Karnataka. In 2014, Thirthahalli taluk of Shimoga district, Karnataka reported an outbreak. Outbreaks occurred in Pali village of Sattari taluka, and three villages (Mauxi, Zarme and Kopardem) under Community Health Centre (CHC) Valpoi, Northeast Goa in 2015. Evidences of KFD virus or related viruses were found in different parts of India (parts of the Saurashtra region in Gujarat State, forested regions west of Kolkata, West Bengal State, and the Andaman Islands) during serological studies. The increase in number of new foci and cases indicates that ecobiological changes due to deforestation and use of new land for farming and cattle grazing could lead to spread of KFD virus to newer geographical areas. Viruses related to KFDV have been identified in China and Saudi Arabia.","entities":[{"id":16122,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":342,"end_offset":346},{"id":16123,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":385,"end_offset":392},{"id":16126,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1843,"end_offset":1852},{"id":16125,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":542,"end_offset":557},{"id":16116,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":35},{"id":16117,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":43,"end_offset":72},{"id":16118,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":77,"end_offset":113},{"id":16119,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":203,"end_offset":215},{"id":16120,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":264,"end_offset":340},{"id":16121,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":251,"end_offset":262}],"relations":[{"id":7798,"from_id":16117,"to_id":16118,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":7799,"from_id":16121,"to_id":16120,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Various causes and associations of corneal anaesthesia are: Fifth cranial nerve palsy: Intracranial: Aneurysms, neoplasms, stroke. Iatrogenic: Surgery for acoustic neuroma or trigeminal neuralgia. Genetic: Familial dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome), Goldenhar-Gorlin syndrome, MÃ¶bius syndrome, familial corneal hypoaesthesia, or congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis. Facial trauma. Ocular: Viral infections: Herpes simplex and Herpes zoster. Toxicity: Chemical injury, toxic keratopathy due to drugs, chronic topical anaesthesia abuse.

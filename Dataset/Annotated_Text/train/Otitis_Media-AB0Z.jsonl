{"id":1373,"text":"#Causes - Otitis Media - AB0Z\nOtitis media (middle ear infection) is caused when a bacterial or viral infection, such as a cold, spreads into a part of the ear known as the Eustachian tube.

Adenoids and tonsils can be removed if they cause a persistent or frequently reoccurring ear infection, this is more common in children than in adults.","entities":[{"id":19179,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":22},{"id":19180,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":30,"end_offset":65},{"id":19187,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":319,"end_offset":327},{"id":19191,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":396,"end_offset":421},{"id":19181,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":83,"end_offset":159},{"id":19182,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":169,"end_offset":188},{"id":19183,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":190,"end_offset":206},{"id":19184,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":210,"end_offset":218},{"id":19185,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":302,"end_offset":317},{"id":19188,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":332,"end_offset":339}],"relations":[{"id":9403,"from_id":19184,"to_id":19185,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":9401,"from_id":19180,"to_id":19182,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":9402,"from_id":19183,"to_id":19185,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":9400,"from_id":19180,"to_id":19181,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

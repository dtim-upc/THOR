Symptoms develop as headache, nasal congestion, nasal discharge (green colour), pain in sinus, bleeding nose, swelling on face, lack of sensation on face and skin discoloration. Pulmonary mucormycosis: When spores are breathed in and reach the respiratory system, they affect the lungs. Symptoms are fever, chest pain, cough and coughing of blood.

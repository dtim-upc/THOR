{"id":569,"text":"#Causes - Bad Breath - MD94\nHalitosis has numerous causes and origins. Poor Oral hygiene: Sometimes it may be a consequence of lifestyle. If you don't brush and floss daily, food particles accumulate in between your teeth and on tongue; bacteria grow on the food left in your mouth and leave foul-smelling waste products (volatile sulphur compounds) behind, which lead to bad breath. Lack of regular tongue cleaning, may be a cause of bad breath despite proper brushing and flossing. Dietary Habits: Intake of certain foods and drinks such as onion, garlic, spices etc. and certain habits such as smoking, using tobacco products, drinking alcohol cause halitosis. Fasting or starvation can also cause bad breath.

{"id":570,"text":"#Overview - Bad Breath - MD94\nBad breath or Halitosis (oral malodour) is an unpleasant odour of the mouth. It is a common complaint for both genders and for all age groups. Nearly more than 50% of the general population in developed countries have halitosis. Bad breath affects a person's daily life, causes social and psychological discomfort for individuals and affect their relation with other people. Mild transient bad breath which often arises after sleep is common and generally not regarded as halitosis. It is termed as “morning halitosis.” Some people complain of halitosis yet there is no measurable halitosis, even with objective testing, this may be a symptom of delusion or mono symptomatic hypochondriasis (self oral malodour). It is known as HALITOPHOBIA or PSEUDOHALITOSIS.","entities":[{"id":9554,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":248,"end_offset":257},{"id":9560,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":574,"end_offset":584},{"id":9562,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":758,"end_offset":789},{"id":9551,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":22},{"id":9552,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":30,"end_offset":53},{"id":9553,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":100,"end_offset":105},{"id":9555,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":259,"end_offset":269},{"id":9557,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":420,"end_offset":430},{"id":9558,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":502,"end_offset":511},{"id":9559,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":530,"end_offset":547},{"id":9561,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":611,"end_offset":620},{"id":9563,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":676,"end_offset":720}],"relations":[{"id":4340,"from_id":9552,"to_id":9553,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":4341,"from_id":9561,"to_id":9563,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Tongue cleaning is usually effective in reducing bad breath. After meals, rinse your mouth vigorously with water. People wearing dentures should make sure that they remove the dentures at night and clean them thoroughly before using them next morning. People with fixed orthodontic appliances should take extra care to maintain their oral hygiene to prevent bad breath.

{"id":572,"text":"#Treatment - Bad Breath - MD94\nFor treatment of halitosis, detecting the cause or determining its source, by detailed clinical examination is important. If you have bad breath despite maintaining good oral hygiene visit your dentist to rule out gum diseases (Gingivitis or Periodontitis) or dry mouth (Xerostomia) and for proper identification and treatment of the problem. Lastly, see your physician if halitosis is persistent as it may be due to some medical problem. Management of halitophobia may be complex but is very important because persons with halitophobia avoid socialising and even avoid talking with people. Before treating people with halitophobia, it must be proven to them that they do not have measurable halitosis by measuring devices. If the person is obsessed with the idea of having bad breath, consultation with a psychologist is required.

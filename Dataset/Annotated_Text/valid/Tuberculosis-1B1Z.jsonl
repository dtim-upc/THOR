{"id":234,"text":"#Overview - Tuberculosis - 1B1Z\nTuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculosis commonly affects   the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. It  spreads from person to person through the air, when people who are infected with TB infection cough, sneeze or otherwise transmit respiratory fluids through the air. About one-quarter of the world’s population is estimated to be infected by TB bacteria but out of these only 5-15% of people will fall ill with active TB disease. The rest have TB infection with no illness and cannot transmit the disease. According to WHO, an estimated 9.9 million people fell ill with TB and 1.5 million people died globally in 2020, despite being a preventable and curable disease.","entities":[{"id":4660,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":32,"end_offset":49},{"id":4667,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":113,"end_offset":125},{"id":4678,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":299,"end_offset":304},{"id":4679,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":306,"end_offset":312},{"id":4680,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":446,"end_offset":448},{"id":4659,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":24},{"id":4665,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":85,"end_offset":111},{"id":4670,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":145,"end_offset":154},{"id":4671,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":176,"end_offset":199},{"id":4672,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":201,"end_offset":203},{"id":4676,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":286,"end_offset":298},{"id":4681,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":515,"end_offset":532},{"id":4682,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":548,"end_offset":560}],"relations":[{"id":1737,"from_id":4660,"to_id":4665,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":1738,"from_id":4667,"to_id":4670,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":1744,"from_id":4667,"to_id":4671,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":1748,"from_id":4676,"to_id":4678,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":1749,"from_id":4676,"to_id":4679,"type":"has_symptom_R"}],"Comments":[]}

B) Contact tracing- Since transmission can occur from index case to the contact any time (before diagnosis or during treatment) all contacts of TB patients must be evaluated. These groups include: All close contacts, especially household contacts.

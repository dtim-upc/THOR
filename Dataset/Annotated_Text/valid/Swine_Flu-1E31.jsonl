{"id":2105,"text":"#Prevention - Swine Flu - 1E31\nThe most effective way to prevent the spread of infections is to practice good hygiene. Vaccination against influenza also has some role. Tips for Prevention: Frequent hand-washing. \"Hands-off-the-face\" approach. Resist all temptations to touch any part of face. Gargle twice a day with warm salt water. (H1N1 takes 2-3 days after initial infection in the throat \/ nasal cavity to proliferate and show characteristic symptoms). Clean your nostrils at least once every day with warm salt water. Blowing the nose hard once a day and swabbing both nostrils with cotton buds dipped in warm salt water is very effective in bringing down viral population. Boost your natural immunity with foods that are rich in Vitamin C (Amla and other citrus fruits). Drink as much of warm liquids (tea, coffee, etc) as you can. Drinking warm liquids has the same effect as gargling, but in the reverse direction. They wash off proliferating viruses from the throat into the stomach where they cannot survive, proliferate or do any harm.","entities":[{"id":26704,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":14,"end_offset":23},{"id":26707,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":190,"end_offset":211},{"id":26709,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":244,"end_offset":292},{"id":26714,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":681,"end_offset":777},{"id":26715,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":779,"end_offset":827},{"id":26705,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":96,"end_offset":117},{"id":26706,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":119,"end_offset":148},{"id":26708,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":214,"end_offset":242},{"id":26711,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":294,"end_offset":333},{"id":26712,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":459,"end_offset":523},{"id":26713,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":525,"end_offset":679},{"id":26716,"label":"Precaution_E","start_offset":840,"end_offset":923}],"relations":[{"id":13696,"from_id":26704,"to_id":26712,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":13695,"from_id":26704,"to_id":26711,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":13694,"from_id":26704,"to_id":26708,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":13692,"from_id":26704,"to_id":26706,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":13700,"from_id":26704,"to_id":26716,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":13699,"from_id":26704,"to_id":26715,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":13693,"from_id":26704,"to_id":26707,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":13698,"from_id":26704,"to_id":26714,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":13697,"from_id":26704,"to_id":26713,"type":"has_precaution_R"},{"id":13691,"from_id":26704,"to_id":26705,"type":"has_precaution_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":2108,"text":"#Overview - Swine Flu - 1E31\nSwine flu also known as swine influenza or Pandemic Influenza is a respiratory disease. It is caused by virus called H1N1 virus (introduced in 2009). This virus infects the wind pipe (respiratory tract) of pigs and later it gets transmitted to human beings. It results in nasal secretions, cough, decreased appetite, and restless behavior. Swine flu was a relatively new strain of influenza virus (flu) that was responsible for a flu pandemic during 2009-2010. Swine flu viruses may mutate (change) so that they are easily transmissible among humans. On 10 August 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the swine flu pandemic was officially over. However, this does not mean that swine flu has been completely eliminated. The H1N1 virus that caused the pandemic is now a regular flu virus and continues to circulate seasonally worldwide.","entities":[{"id":26736,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":21},{"id":26743,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":202,"end_offset":239},{"id":26745,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":319,"end_offset":324},{"id":26747,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":350,"end_offset":367},{"id":26757,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":817,"end_offset":834},{"id":26748,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":287,"end_offset":289},{"id":26749,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":369,"end_offset":378},{"id":26750,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":410,"end_offset":431},{"id":26751,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":459,"end_offset":462},{"id":26752,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":490,"end_offset":507},{"id":26755,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":768,"end_offset":782},{"id":26737,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":29,"end_offset":38},{"id":26738,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":53,"end_offset":68},{"id":26739,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":72,"end_offset":90},{"id":26740,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":146,"end_offset":155},{"id":26742,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":179,"end_offset":197},{"id":26744,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":301,"end_offset":317},{"id":26746,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":326,"end_offset":344},{"id":26753,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":653,"end_offset":662},{"id":26754,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":726,"end_offset":735}],"relations":[{"id":13712,"from_id":26748,"to_id":26747,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":13709,"from_id":26748,"to_id":26744,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":13708,"from_id":26742,"to_id":26743,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":13713,"from_id":26757,"to_id":26755,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13711,"from_id":26748,"to_id":26746,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":13710,"from_id":26748,"to_id":26745,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

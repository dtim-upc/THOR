{"id":2254,"text":"#Causes - Scrub Typhus - 1C30.3\nScrub typhus is caused by a bacterium called Orientia tsutsugamushi. Infection is transmitted by the mite Leptotrombidium deliense. Human beings are infected when they walk into the mite islands (areas in the soil where the microecosystem is favourable for mites) and are bitten by the mite larvae (chiggers). The microbes are transmitted through ovarian transmission (certain arthropod vectors transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod) in mites.","entities":[{"id":28491,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":22},{"id":28493,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":58,"end_offset":99},{"id":28496,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":133,"end_offset":162},{"id":28492,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":32,"end_offset":44},{"id":28494,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":101,"end_offset":111},{"id":28498,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":318,"end_offset":340}],"relations":[{"id":14581,"from_id":28492,"to_id":28493,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":1854,"text":"#Diagnosis - Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis - 9A60.02\nDiagnostic procedures: Investigations are generally not required. Intra-dermal skin test: Intra-dermal skin test is the standard clinical test for the diagnosis of type I hypersensitivity reaction. Cutaneous tests, such as the scratch, prick or patch, and more rarely, the intra-cutaneous injections, may be utilised to determine the antigens causing hypersensitivity. Superficial conjunctival scrapings: Superficial conjunctival scrapings in more active cases may help to establish the diagnosis by revealing characteristic eosinophils which are not normally present on the conjunctiva. Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST): Radio-allergo-sorbent test (RAST), a blood test, may also help to define the allergens. Conjunctival provocation test (CPT): Conjunctival provocation test consist of instilling offending pollen into the conjunctival sac, producing the typical symptoms of SAC. Nasal allergy test: There is also a possible involvement of nasal allergy in some patients with allergic conjunctivitis, such as SAC, and therefore, there may be value to a nasal challenge with allergen combined with registration of ocular features. Tear film mediators: Quantitative analysis of tear film inflammatory mediators is used as a disease marker and to understand immune mechanisms.","entities":[{"id":24312,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":329,"end_offset":355},{"id":24309,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":45},{"id":24310,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":122,"end_offset":144},{"id":24311,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":254,"end_offset":269},{"id":24313,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":425,"end_offset":459},{"id":24314,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":581,"end_offset":592},{"id":24318,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":767,"end_offset":802},{"id":24319,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":882,"end_offset":898},{"id":24320,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":934,"end_offset":937},{"id":24322,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1035,"end_offset":1058},{"id":24325,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1235,"end_offset":1267},{"id":24315,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":631,"end_offset":642},{"id":24316,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":644,"end_offset":677},{"id":24317,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":716,"end_offset":726},{"id":24321,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":999,"end_offset":1012},{"id":24323,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1068,"end_offset":1071},{"id":24324,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1189,"end_offset":1208}],"relations":[{"id":12370,"from_id":24318,"to_id":24319,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":12375,"from_id":24313,"to_id":24309,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12378,"from_id":24309,"to_id":24325,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12371,"from_id":24323,"to_id":24322,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":12372,"from_id":24309,"to_id":24310,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12373,"from_id":24309,"to_id":24311,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12374,"from_id":24309,"to_id":24312,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12376,"from_id":24316,"to_id":24309,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":12377,"from_id":24309,"to_id":24324,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":2090,"text":"#Overview - Scurvy - 5B56.0\nScurvy is a medical condition that can develops due to deficiency of vitamin C in diet. Vitamin C (also called ascorbic acid) is vital for the body as it is needed to make collagen. Collagen is a type of protein found in many different types of tissue, such as skin, blood vessels, bones and cartilage (which covers the surface of joints). Without vitamin C, collagen can't be replaced and the different types of tissue break down. Scurvy was common in sailors, pirates and others aboard ships at sea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored (subsisting instead only on cured and salted meats and dried grains) and some soldiers similarly deprived of these foods for extended periods which led to deficiency of vitamin C in the body.","entities":[{"id":26602,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":18},{"id":26603,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":28,"end_offset":34},{"id":26604,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":83,"end_offset":114},{"id":26609,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":460,"end_offset":466},{"id":26610,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":481,"end_offset":488},{"id":26611,"label":"Riskfactor_E","start_offset":490,"end_offset":497},{"id":26606,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":289,"end_offset":293},{"id":26608,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":310,"end_offset":366},{"id":26605,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":273,"end_offset":279},{"id":26607,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":295,"end_offset":308}],"relations":[{"id":13633,"from_id":26603,"to_id":26604,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13634,"from_id":26609,"to_id":26610,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"},{"id":13635,"from_id":26609,"to_id":26611,"type":"has_risk_factor_R"}],"Comments":[]}

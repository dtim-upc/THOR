History of atopy in patient or the family, elevated serum level of total and specific IgE, higher number of eosinophils and mast cells, increased level of mediators and favourable response to anti-allergic therapy is observed in VKC.

Education of patients and their parents about the chronic, recurrent and ultimately resolving nature of disease is an important aspect of management. Compliance with medical advice is better with a well-informed patient. Medical therapy: General measures: Avoid non-specific triggering stimuli: Avoid non-specific triggering stimuli such as exposure to wind, sun and salt water which causes frequent conjunctival redness. Avoid allergens: Contact with common allergens like plants and flowers should be avoided. Sunglasses: Use of protective sunglasses is helpful and should be advised. Artificial tears: Artificial tears have been shown to be effective in relief of symptoms by direct removal and dilution of allergens from the ocular surface. Cold compresses: cold compresses provide symptomatic relief, especially from ocular pruritus. Frequent washing: Frequent face, hand and hair washing, especially before going to bed, may be helpful. Drug therapy: Most drugs used are merely palliative, and are not enough to treat and eliminate allergic ocular inflammation, so there is recurrence of disease on discontinuation of therapy. Judicious and scrupulous use of medicines is important because drug treatment is prolonged and frequent.

Role of genetic predisposition and environmental factors in onset, its progression and resolution of this self-limiting disease, is not clear. Genetics of disease: No genetic predisposing factor has been identified, but the predominance of VKC in Asia and Africa strengthens the possibility of a genetic predisposition. Type I (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction occur when a sensitised individual comes into contact with a specific antigen. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) has a strong affinity for mast cells, and the cross-linking of IgE with antigen triggers mast cell degranulation. Mast cell degranulation releases various mediators of inflammatory cascade which results in an increase in vascular permeability and migration of eosinophils and neutrophils. Associated conditions: Family history of allergic disorders and multiple atopic diseases may be present in some patients suffering from VKC. Conditions which may be associated with VKC are: Atopy: Atopy, defined as the presence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, is common among VKC patients. Asthma is the most common atopic disease found among VKC patients. Other associated atopic diseases may be eczema, rhinitis or urticaria. Keratoconus (conical cornea) and acute hydrops (stromal oedema due to leakage of aqueous): Keratoconus and acute hydrops may be associated with VKC.

{"id":2125,"text":"#Causes - Silicosis - CA60.0Z\nSilicosis is caused by exposure to crystalline silica. Silica (SiO2 \/ silicon dioxide) is combination of silicon and oxygen. Silicon is very reactive, does not remain in the element form but combines either with oxygen and forms free silica (SiO2) or with oxygen and other elements and forms silicates such as asbestos. Silica and silicates constitute the bulk of most kinds of rocks, clays and sands. Crystalline silica is found in rock, brick, and concrete. Grinding, sawing, crushing, or drilling of these materials produce a fine powder that causes serious respiratory problems.Occupational exposure to silica occurs at workplaces in factories like quartz crushing facilities (silica flour milling), agate, ceramic, slate pencil, glass, stone quarries and mines. Silica flour in India is produced by small factories. Non-occupational exposure to silica- Silicosis is also reported in population with Non-occupational exposure from industrial sources and non-industrial sources.","entities":[{"id":26938,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":851,"end_offset":886},{"id":26940,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":583,"end_offset":611},{"id":26935,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":20},{"id":26936,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":30,"end_offset":40},{"id":26939,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":612,"end_offset":643},{"id":26941,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":490,"end_offset":570},{"id":26942,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":888,"end_offset":898},{"id":26937,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":53,"end_offset":83}],"relations":[{"id":13794,"from_id":26942,"to_id":26938,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13797,"from_id":26935,"to_id":26939,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13795,"from_id":26936,"to_id":26937,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13796,"from_id":26935,"to_id":26941,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Primary prevention includes the control of silica hazard at source by the engineering methods of dust control. If occupational exposure to dust is avoided, silicosis will cease to occur.

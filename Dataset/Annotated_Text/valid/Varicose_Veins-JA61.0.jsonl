{"id":2190,"text":"#Overview - Varicose Veins - JA61.0\nVaricose veins are swollen and enlarged veins, usually blue or dark purple in color. They may also be lumpy, bulging or twisted in appearance. They mostly occur in the legs. The blood is prevented from flowing backwards by a series of tiny valves that open and close to let blood through. If the valves weaken or are damaged, the blood can flow backwards and can collect in the vein, eventually causing it to be swollen and enlarged (varicose). This allows blood to flow backwards and they enlarge even more. Varicose veins are most common in the superficial veins of the legs, which are subject to high pressure when standing. Besides being a cosmetic problem, varicose veins can be painful, especially when standing. Severe long-standing varicose veins can lead to leg swelling, venous eczema, skin thickening and ulceration. Life-threatening complications are uncommon, but Varicose veins may be confused for deep vein thrombosis, that may be life-threatening.","entities":[{"id":27846,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":26},{"id":27848,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":55,"end_offset":119},{"id":27849,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":204,"end_offset":208},{"id":27850,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":179,"end_offset":183},{"id":27851,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":214,"end_offset":219},{"id":27857,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":493,"end_offset":498},{"id":27865,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":698,"end_offset":712},{"id":27872,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":803,"end_offset":815},{"id":27873,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":817,"end_offset":830},{"id":27875,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":852,"end_offset":862},{"id":27876,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":913,"end_offset":927},{"id":27852,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":414,"end_offset":418},{"id":27847,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":36,"end_offset":50},{"id":27854,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":448,"end_offset":479},{"id":27859,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":545,"end_offset":559},{"id":27862,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":583,"end_offset":612},{"id":27866,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":720,"end_offset":753},{"id":27870,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":755,"end_offset":790},{"id":27874,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":832,"end_offset":847},{"id":27877,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":948,"end_offset":968}],"relations":[{"id":14213,"from_id":27854,"to_id":27852,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":14216,"from_id":27870,"to_id":27872,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14217,"from_id":27870,"to_id":27873,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14221,"from_id":27870,"to_id":27875,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14206,"from_id":27847,"to_id":27848,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14211,"from_id":27850,"to_id":27849,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":14214,"from_id":27859,"to_id":27862,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":14215,"from_id":27865,"to_id":27866,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14219,"from_id":27870,"to_id":27874,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14225,"from_id":27876,"to_id":27877,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Regular exercise The wearing of graduated compression stockings with variable pressure gradients (Class II or III) has been shown to reduce the swelling, nutritional exchange, and improve the micro circulation in legs affected by varicose veins. Surgery: Ligation and stripping: Most surgeons use a technique called ligation and stripping, which involves tying off the vein in the affected leg and then removing it.

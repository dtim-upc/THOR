Spheroidal degeneration is characterised by sub-epithelial accumulation of spherical opalescent droplets that coalesce to form bands or nodules with elevated corneal epithelium. The degenerative process is mainly seen in the inter-palpebral part of the cornea.","entities":[{"id":24421,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":35},{"id":24422,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":46,"end_offset":69},{"id":24423,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":71,"end_offset":99},{"id":24424,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":101,"end_offset":139},{"id":24427,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":199,"end_offset":234},{"id":24428,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":257,"end_offset":280},{"id":24425,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":141,"end_offset":168},{"id":24426,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":172,"end_offset":192},{"id":24429,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":415,"end_offset":433},{"id":24430,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":482,"end_offset":516},{"id":24431,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":439,"end_offset":459}],"relations":[{"id":12438,"from_id":24428,"to_id":24429,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":12439,"from_id":24431,"to_id":24430,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":12437,"from_id":24422,"to_id":24427,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

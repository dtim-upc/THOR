{"id":2283,"text":"#Causes - Steatoablepharon - H02.36\nSteatoblepharon may be a familial condition in younger individuals, and is not associated with signs of ageing. In most cases, steatoblepharon is due to involutional process, associated with laxity of eyelids or dermatochalasis. Excessive steatoblepharon may be associated with systemic disease such as Gravesâ€™ ophthalmopathy, where fat is increased in volume and may also be oedematous.","entities":[{"id":28816,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":227,"end_offset":263},{"id":28814,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":163,"end_offset":179},{"id":28817,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":265,"end_offset":290},{"id":28811,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":27},{"id":28813,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":36,"end_offset":52},{"id":28818,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":314,"end_offset":361}],"relations":[{"id":14740,"from_id":28817,"to_id":28818,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14739,"from_id":28814,"to_id":28816,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":2284,"text":"#Overview - Steatoablepharon - H02.36\nSteatoblepharon is the anterior prolapse of eyelid fat pad, due to weakening of orbital septum, resulting in a puffy appearance of the eyes. The eyelid fat pads play an important role in maintaining contour of eyelids. Eyelid fat provides fullness and smoothness to both upper and lower eyelids. Instead of prolapse, atrophy of eyelid fat may cause posterior sinking of eyelids resulting in involutional enophthalmos.","entities":[{"id":28819,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":29},{"id":28820,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":38,"end_offset":54},{"id":28822,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":105,"end_offset":177},{"id":28825,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":355,"end_offset":376},{"id":28826,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":387,"end_offset":415},{"id":28821,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":61,"end_offset":96},{"id":28823,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":248,"end_offset":255},{"id":28824,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":309,"end_offset":332}],"relations":[{"id":14741,"from_id":28820,"to_id":28821,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14742,"from_id":28820,"to_id":28822,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}
{"id":2285,"text":"#Treatment - Steatoablepharon - H02.36\nTreatment is primarily surgical. It is often combined with blepharoplasty. For mild fat prolapse, orbital septum may be tightened. For significant degrees of fat prolapse, orbital septum is opened and fat pocket is cauterised and excised. In lower eyelid steatoblepharon without dermatochalasis, fat pockets are removed through a trans-conjunctival incision, without disturbing the orbital septum. In cases with excess skin in lower eyelid, a trans-cutaneous incision is preferred, and the skin is tightened laterally. Repositioning of fat beneath the descended malar fat pad may also be done.","entities":[{"id":28831,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":197,"end_offset":209},{"id":28837,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":281,"end_offset":333},{"id":28839,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":558,"end_offset":614},{"id":28842,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":335,"end_offset":435},{"id":28843,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":480,"end_offset":556},{"id":28827,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":30},{"id":28828,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":62,"end_offset":70},{"id":28829,"label":"Surgery_E","start_offset":98,"end_offset":112},{"id":28830,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":118,"end_offset":135},{"id":28836,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":451,"end_offset":478},{"id":28840,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":137,"end_offset":168},{"id":28841,"label":"Medicine_E","start_offset":211,"end_offset":276}],"relations":[{"id":14746,"from_id":28829,"to_id":28827,"type":"surgery_for_R"},{"id":14747,"from_id":28840,"to_id":28827,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":14750,"from_id":28843,"to_id":28827,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":14751,"from_id":28839,"to_id":28827,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":14745,"from_id":28828,"to_id":28827,"type":"surgery_for_R"},{"id":14748,"from_id":28841,"to_id":28827,"type":"prescribed_for_R"},{"id":14749,"from_id":28842,"to_id":28827,"type":"prescribed_for_R"}],"Comments":[]}

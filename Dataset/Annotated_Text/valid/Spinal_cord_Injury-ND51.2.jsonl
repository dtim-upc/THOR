SCI, with its resultant paralysis is one of the most devastating medical conditions of public health importance. Every year 250000-500000 people suffer from SCI globally. Majority of these cases are due to preventable causes such as road traffic accidents, falls, violence. Premature deaths are two to five times more common in people with SCI than people without a spinal cord injury. Spinal cord injury (SCI) resulting into paralysis has devastating physical, mental, social, sexual and vocational consequences for the injured. In addition, the injury increases the economic burden on the person who sustains an SCI and potentially his or her entire support network.

The next step for diagnosing a spinal cord injury is to assess an individual’s neurologic function. A neurological examination includes testing for muscle strength, sensory function and movement in arms and legs\/body. Diagnostic tests for a spinal cord injury include: Plane x-rays-it detects vertebral misalignment or fracture though tissue masses such as injured ligaments or a bulging disc are not visible on conventional x-rays. Computerized tomography (CT)-it is used to detect bone fractures, bleeding, and spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal), but CT has less ability to image the spinal cord or identify ligament injury associated with an unstable spine than MRI. A CT scan may provide a better look at abnormalities seen on an X-ray. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-It can detect brain and spinal trauma from injury, as well as helps in diagnosing brain and spinal cord tumors, herniated disks, vascular (blood vessel) irregularities, bleeding and inflammation that might compress the spine and spinal cord, and injury to the ligaments that support the cervical spine.","entities":[{"id":26902,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":31},{"id":26903,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":192,"end_offset":210},{"id":26905,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":263,"end_offset":287},{"id":26906,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":297,"end_offset":377},{"id":26908,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":430,"end_offset":442},{"id":26909,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":573,"end_offset":592},{"id":26910,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":594,"end_offset":622},{"id":26912,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":660,"end_offset":668},{"id":26914,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":727,"end_offset":729},{"id":26919,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":908,"end_offset":913},{"id":26920,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":915,"end_offset":947},{"id":26921,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":962,"end_offset":967},{"id":26927,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1030,"end_offset":1058},{"id":26929,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1077,"end_offset":1115},{"id":26930,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1117,"end_offset":1142},{"id":26904,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":217,"end_offset":259},{"id":26907,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":402,"end_offset":428},{"id":26911,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":644,"end_offset":658},{"id":26913,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":674,"end_offset":721},{"id":26915,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":760,"end_offset":771},{"id":26916,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":839,"end_offset":842},{"id":26917,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":784,"end_offset":799},{"id":26918,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":846,"end_offset":853},{"id":26922,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":979,"end_offset":985},{"id":26928,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1060,"end_offset":1075},{"id":26931,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1154,"end_offset":1188},{"id":26932,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":1194,"end_offset":1217},{"id":26933,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":1235,"end_offset":1249}],"relations":[{"id":13792,"from_id":26920,"to_id":26922,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":13791,"from_id":26920,"to_id":26921,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":13789,"from_id":26902,"to_id":26910,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13788,"from_id":26914,"to_id":26915,"type":"diagnosis_on_R"},{"id":13787,"from_id":26907,"to_id":26908,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13786,"from_id":26902,"to_id":26906,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13784,"from_id":26903,"to_id":26904,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13793,"from_id":26932,"to_id":26933,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":13790,"from_id":26902,"to_id":26920,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13785,"from_id":26902,"to_id":26905,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

On an individual level spinal cord injuries can be prevented by : Always wear a seatbelt when driving or riding in a motor vehicle and use child safety restraints in the vehicle. Always wear a helmet when riding a motorcycle or bicycle. Never drive a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or ride with anyone who has. Avoid distractions (like phone calls, texting) while driving and pay close attention to the road. Follow the speed limits and traffic rules. Keep a clean home eliminating fall hazards inside the house as slips and falls occur more frequently in the home. When participating in sports, always use appropriate protective equipment. Never dive into shallow and dirty water. Use window guards to prevent falls.

Primary infection with Varicella zoster virus (VZV), known as varicella or chickenpox is a common erythematous infection of the paediatric age group. VZV remains dormant in cranial nerve neurons and dorsal root ganglia. Subsequent reactivation, more so during periods of stress, may result in prodromal period of severe pain followed by localised vesicular rash, known as herpes zoster infection.","entities":[{"id":26096,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":10,"end_offset":30},{"id":26097,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":40,"end_offset":60},{"id":26099,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":223,"end_offset":246},{"id":26101,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":360,"end_offset":379},{"id":26103,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":533,"end_offset":556},{"id":26098,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":78,"end_offset":159},{"id":26100,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":334,"end_offset":355},{"id":26102,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":454,"end_offset":485},{"id":26104,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":498,"end_offset":522}],"relations":[{"id":13394,"from_id":26097,"to_id":26098,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

{"id":2026,"text":"#Diagnosis - Ramsay Hunt Syndrome - 8B88.Y\nDiagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome is based upon the clinical history of otalgia associated with vesicular lesions or eschars, and facial paralysis. Histology: There is swelling and inflammation of the ganglion of affected cranial nerve with VZV. Inflammation is predominantly lymphocytic in nature. Some cells of the ganglion show swelling and others may be degenerated. Investigations: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Magnetic Resonance Imaging shows enhancement of a large portion of facial nerve. Brainstem auditory evoked response: Brainstem auditory evoked response shows significant increase in latencies of certain waves, and also inter-peak latencies in others. Saliva: VZV DNA level in saliva helps to understand viral reactivation in facial nerve and oropharyngeal epithelium. Cerebrospinal fluid: Real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of CSF may be done to diagnose this virus.","entities":[{"id":26115,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":56,"end_offset":76},{"id":26116,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":191,"end_offset":200},{"id":26120,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":545,"end_offset":579},{"id":26121,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":715,"end_offset":721},{"id":26114,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":33},{"id":26117,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":211,"end_offset":287},{"id":26118,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":430,"end_offset":462},{"id":26119,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":342,"end_offset":368},{"id":26122,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":832,"end_offset":851},{"id":26123,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":853,"end_offset":901}],"relations":[{"id":13407,"from_id":26114,"to_id":26123,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13406,"from_id":26114,"to_id":26122,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13404,"from_id":26114,"to_id":26120,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13403,"from_id":26114,"to_id":26118,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13402,"from_id":26114,"to_id":26116,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13405,"from_id":26114,"to_id":26121,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"}],"Comments":[]}

This is the second most common cause of facial paralysis and is due to reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that remains dormant\/latent in the geniculate ganglion after primary infection with chickenpox.

{"id":2115,"text":"#Diagnosis - Syphilis - 1A6Z\nPhysical examination: The doctor will examine genitals. For men, it involves examining  the penis, foreskin and urethra (the hole at the end of the penis where urine comes out). For women, it involves an internal examination of the vagina. Both men and women may also have their anus examined. Blood tests: If one is infected with syphilis, then his\/ her body produces antibodies (proteins released as part of immune response) against the syphilis bacteria. Therefore, one way to determine whether one have syphilis is to have a sample of blood tested for the presence of these antibodies. A positive result (antibodies present) indicates that one can  either have the infection or used to have it (because the antibodies can remain in the body for years, even after a previous infection was successfully treated). A negative result does not necessarily mean that one does not have syphilis as the antibodies may not be detectable for three months after infection. Person may be advised to repeat the test in three months time. Every pregnant woman should have a blood test for syphilis as the infection can kill unborn or newborn babies. The blood test is usually done during an antenatal appointment at weeks 11â€“20 of pregnancy. If the test is positive, treatment for both the mother and baby can begin. Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL): The VDRL test is a screening test for syphilis. It measures substances, called antibodies, that body may produce if a person comes in contact with the bacteria that causes syphilis. This bacteria is called Treponema pallidum. Swab test- If sores are present, a swab (like a cotton bud) will be used to take a small sample of fluid from the sore. This is then either looked at under a microscope in the clinic or sent to a laboratory for examination.","entities":[{"id":26797,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":29,"end_offset":49},{"id":26800,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":233,"end_offset":267},{"id":26801,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":308,"end_offset":321},{"id":26803,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":360,"end_offset":368},{"id":26804,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":468,"end_offset":485},{"id":26806,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1168,"end_offset":1182},{"id":26813,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1611,"end_offset":1620},{"id":26796,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":13,"end_offset":21},{"id":26799,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":106,"end_offset":205},{"id":26802,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":323,"end_offset":334},{"id":26805,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":536,"end_offset":544},{"id":26807,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1335,"end_offset":1383},{"id":26808,"label":"Diagnosis_E","start_offset":1389,"end_offset":1393},{"id":26809,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1423,"end_offset":1431},{"id":26810,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1591,"end_offset":1609},{"id":26811,"label":"Cause_E","start_offset":1532,"end_offset":1544},{"id":26812,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":1557,"end_offset":1565}],"relations":[{"id":13737,"from_id":26796,"to_id":26801,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13736,"from_id":26796,"to_id":26800,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13744,"from_id":26796,"to_id":26813,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13743,"from_id":26812,"to_id":26811,"type":"caused_by_R"},{"id":13739,"from_id":26803,"to_id":26802,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13735,"from_id":26796,"to_id":26799,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13733,"from_id":26796,"to_id":26797,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13742,"from_id":26809,"to_id":26806,"type":"has_diagnosis_R"},{"id":13741,"from_id":26803,"to_id":26804,"type":"caused_by_R"}],"Comments":[]}

The symptoms develop in three stages: Primary syphilis. Secondary syphilis. Tertiary syphilis. Primary syphilis : The initial symptoms of syphilis can appear any time from 10 days to three months after one have been exposed to the infection. The most common symptom is the appearance of a small, painless sore or ulcer (called chancre). The sore will appear on the part of  body where the infection was transmitted, typically the penis, vagina, anus, rectum, tongue or lips. Most people only have one sore, but some people can have more. The sores are painless and may be overlooked, so the condition can be spread without realizing that have an infection. The sore will then disappear within two to six weeks and, if the condition is not treated, syphilis will move into its second stage. Secondary syphilis : The symptoms of secondary syphilis will begin a few weeks after the disappearance of the sore. Common symptoms include: A non-itchy skin rash appearing anywhere on the body, but commonly on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. Tiredness. Headaches. Swollen lymph glands. Less common symptoms include: Fever. Weight loss. Patchy hair loss. Joint pains. These symptoms may disappear within a few weeks, or come and go over a period of months.","entities":[{"id":26820,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":44,"end_offset":52},{"id":26824,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":243,"end_offset":259},{"id":26827,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":686,"end_offset":803},{"id":26828,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":485,"end_offset":621},{"id":26829,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":623,"end_offset":684},{"id":26832,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1194,"end_offset":1203},{"id":26835,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1268,"end_offset":1273},{"id":26837,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1288,"end_offset":1304},{"id":26819,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":20},{"id":26821,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":186,"end_offset":202},{"id":26822,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":204,"end_offset":222},{"id":26823,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":224,"end_offset":241},{"id":26825,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":286,"end_offset":294},{"id":26826,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":421,"end_offset":483},{"id":26830,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":938,"end_offset":956},{"id":26831,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1079,"end_offset":1192},{"id":26833,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1205,"end_offset":1214},{"id":26834,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1216,"end_offset":1236},{"id":26836,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1275,"end_offset":1286},{"id":26838,"label":"Symptom_E","start_offset":1306,"end_offset":1317}],"relations":[{"id":13758,"from_id":26819,"to_id":26837,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13755,"from_id":26819,"to_id":26834,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13754,"from_id":26819,"to_id":26833,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13750,"from_id":26819,"to_id":26829,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13749,"from_id":26819,"to_id":26828,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13759,"from_id":26819,"to_id":26838,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13757,"from_id":26819,"to_id":26836,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13756,"from_id":26819,"to_id":26835,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13753,"from_id":26819,"to_id":26832,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13752,"from_id":26819,"to_id":26831,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13751,"from_id":26819,"to_id":26827,"type":"has_symptom_R"},{"id":13748,"from_id":26819,"to_id":26826,"type":"has_symptom_R"}],"Comments":[]}

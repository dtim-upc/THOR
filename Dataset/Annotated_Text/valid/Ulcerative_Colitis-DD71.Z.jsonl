Ulcerative colitis is a form of colitis, a disease of the colon (large intestine) that includes characteristic ulcers or open sores. Ulcerative colitis is similar to Crohn's disease, another form of IBD. Ulcerative colitis is an intermittent disease, with periods of exacerbated symptoms, and periods that are relatively symptom free. Ulcerative colitis is treated as an autoimmune disease.","entities":[{"id":28094,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":12,"end_offset":30},{"id":28095,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":40,"end_offset":42},{"id":28096,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":56,"end_offset":88},{"id":28097,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":90,"end_offset":108},{"id":28099,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":133,"end_offset":153},{"id":28100,"label":"Anatomy_E","start_offset":155,"end_offset":170},{"id":28102,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":122,"end_offset":129},{"id":28105,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":201,"end_offset":207},{"id":28106,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":211,"end_offset":221},{"id":28107,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":223,"end_offset":241},{"id":28109,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":256,"end_offset":271},{"id":28111,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":294,"end_offset":312},{"id":28113,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":319,"end_offset":339},{"id":28114,"label":"Disease_E","start_offset":425,"end_offset":443},{"id":28115,"label":"Complication_E","start_offset":461,"end_offset":479}],"relations":[{"id":14353,"from_id":28097,"to_id":28099,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14355,"from_id":28102,"to_id":28100,"type":"influence_R"},{"id":14358,"from_id":28097,"to_id":28106,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14359,"from_id":28111,"to_id":28113,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14351,"from_id":28095,"to_id":28096,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14352,"from_id":28097,"to_id":28102,"type":"has_complication_R"},{"id":14354,"from_id":28097,"to_id":28100,"type":"affects_R"},{"id":14357,"from_id":28097,"to_id":28105,"type":"has_complication_R"}],"Comments":[]}

Common toxic agents are glaucoma medications, preservatives, antibiotics and antivirals.

Attempts should be made to stop medications or to substitute them with less toxic or preservative-free formulations. Contact lens wear, if required, should be used cautiously, since they can act as a toxic reservoir. Cold compresses: Cold compresses may be soothing and may help in ocular irritation. Medical therapy: Preservative free artificial tears: For mild disease, a preservative free artificial tear may be used for symptomatic relief. Topical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroids may be needed for more symptomatic patients. Surgical therapy: Patients may require surgical measures, for complications and sequlae, such as: Tarsorrhaphy: Tarsorrhaphy may be required for persistent corneal epithelial defects. Conjunctival flap: Conjunctival flap is an alternative for persistent epithelial defects of cornea.

{"id":2281,"text":"#Diagnosis - Toxic conjunctivitis - 9A60.2\nDiagnostic tests: Most tests are not practical or not widely available and are difficult to perform in the clinical set up. Conjunctival Scraping: The presence of eosinophils and basophils on conjunctival scrapings points to an allergic reaction but it is relatively non-specific, since these cells can also be found in toxic keratoconjunctivitis. In clinical setting, this test is most often used to rule out infectious disease and allergy. Conjunctival Biopsy: Conjunctival biopsies are reserved for confirmation or exclusion of autoimmune diseases and are usually reserved for the diagnosis of cicatrising conjunctivitis (e.g. pemphigoid). Patients, after long-term glaucoma treatment, may show squamous metaplasia of the conjunctival epithelium and sub-conjunctival inflammation and fibrosis. Impression Cytology: Impression Cytology provides a homogeneous cell layer for histological studies. Epithelial cells, goblet cells and inflammatory cells can be differentiated with immune-staining and can even be used for flow cytometry analysis, which allows measurement of membrane and cytoplasmic inflammatory markers.
